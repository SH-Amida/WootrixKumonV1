            <title>3 Mobile Maintenance Trends to Follow</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/9/2/f6d6cde1-4aa2-4179-b170-f6944adc0b90_mobile device-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 307px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Today&amp;#39;s manufacturing world requires a new kind of talent. Many young professionals seeking job opportunities are less likely to pursue science, technology, engineering and math degrees. This has caused a significant skills gap between senior manufacturing employees and potential candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this skills gap may raise concerns as experts reach retirement, the good news is that the industry is now finding millennials are fully capable of taking on manufacturing careers. When combined with a professional career path, jobs within manufacturing bring out the tech-savvy strengths new hires have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The impact of computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) has shown that self-service mobile technology combined with manufacturing opens many doors to improve an organization&amp;#39;s bottom line. In an industry that relies on maximizing equipment uptime, maintenance personnel have the potential to revolutionize operations if given the right tools. Luckily, these tools are already right in the palms of millennial hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	1. A New Generation is Taking Charge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A number of maintenance stereotypes are going by the wayside as baby boomers retire. Today&amp;#39;s expert &amp;quot;knowledge economy&amp;quot; includes both historical information on how to maintain equipment and the technology to support a company&amp;#39;s bottom line with data. Organizing a maintenance knowledge base that combines the two has become a high priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The technology introduced in today&amp;#39;s facilities can even archive training materials for future technicians. For established operations, this means a video or guide can be saved in the cloud and accessed with a mobile device to demonstrate exactly how to do the job while onsite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As senior maintenance technicians retire, new hires are taken much more seriously and expected to have strong technological competencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	2. Condition-based Maintenance Means Real-time Reactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ability to track the present condition of an asset was once reserved for only the largest facilities. Now the market has shifted to allow for more competitive prices on hardware advancements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even for the startup or small business, it&amp;#39;s entirely possible to have the most cutting-edge technology for supporting a &amp;quot;smart building.&amp;quot; Investments in the sensors that allow machines to &amp;quot;talk&amp;quot; are gaining momentum. Many buzzwords describe this phenomenon such as the industrial Internet of things and machine-to-machine data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A thorough understanding of your equipment can lead to maximum uptime, as your facility runs at full speed and personnel can easily detect any issue. When everyone has a mobile device and access to a system that connects machines to staff in real-time, there are minimal surprises and well-defined workflows for handling anything that could come your team&amp;#39;s way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These systems result in more insightful decision-making by maintenance staff. Workers with the right ambition and initiative can access the data needed to do their jobs even better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	3. Connecting through the Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance personnel are using mobile technology to make their jobs more efficient. This isn&amp;#39;t just a manufacturing trend; it&amp;#39;s happening to jobs across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The difficulty for this profession is that maintenance technicians aren&amp;#39;t historically known as a tech-savvy workforce. Until very recently, maintenance departments were considered a cost center that had to take an &amp;quot;if it&amp;#39;s not broken, don&amp;#39;t fix it&amp;quot; approach. The impact of using data for conducting maintenance has changed how these departments operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the past, an investment in a solution to better organize work orders wasn&amp;#39;t highly considered. Now, these solutions not only handle work orders but also predictive plotting and custom visualizations. Because it&amp;#39;s common for maintenance technicians to understand mobile nuances, organizations can reap the benefits from collecting and structuring asset data to be readily available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Moving Forward&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CMMS is one type of maintenance solution that has received attention from small to midsized operations due to mobile features such as work-order tracking and fleet management. Of course, maintenance software is typically slow to catch on until standards are set in place. Since mobile and cloud technologies have become mainstream, adoption is now happening faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Why You Need a CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/7/15/ad7790b2-a2de-4987-ac85-ebb19e5cd112_Maintenance-Workers.jpeg" style="width: 299px; height: 306px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;If someone asked about your maintenance plan, what would you say? Do you have a proper plan in place? Is it working? How are you tracking it? What is your return on investment (ROI) year over year? These are questions most companies face. A computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) can provide the solution while helping your business save money in training, documentation and energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Protecting Your Business&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A proper infrastructure relates back to the initial plans to maintain it. The 80/20 rule is a great reference because 80 percent of your maintenance activities should be proactive, while 20 percent should be for unplanned maintenance items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a business constantly waits for items to burn out, the end result will be spending more money in fixing the problem rather than maintaining it. This is the curse of the &amp;quot;why fix something if it isn&amp;#39;t broken&amp;quot; approach. People generally focus on the initial cost rather than the long-term benefits of using a CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, if a staff member does not regularly check a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) unit for corrosion using a CMMS, there is a good chance the unit could break unexpectedly, causing the repair cost to be higher than if there was a proper maintenance plan in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	10 Maintenance ROI Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance involves several assets in a business including training, documentation and utilities. Below are the top 10 maintenance ROI statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A company can save between 12 to 18 percent using preventive maintenance over reactive maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Facilities implementing proper HVAC maintenance will use 15 to 20 percent less energy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Every dollar spent on preventive maintenance will save you $5 on other expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Commissioning can save a typical 100,000-square-foot hotel 10 to 15 percent of its energy costs or roughly $20,000 per year.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Buildings in the United States were responsible for 39 percent of U.S energy consumption in 2005. Of that total, commercial buildings accounted for 46.3 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eighty percent of employees waste an average of 30 minutes per day retrieving information.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Professionals spend 5 to 15 percent reading information but up to 50 percent looking for it.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The average spending per learner is $1,202.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eighteen minutes is the average search time for a document.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		One bad review can cost you 30 customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Turning ROI Statistics into Reality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even in a small business, paper documents, assets, etc., can be challenging to keep track of and require a lot of time. Relying solely on a paper-based system is not practical in today&amp;#39;s world, especially when software makes it easier. The goal is to work harder and smarter. Work harder on a maintenance plan and smarter by delegating tasks that are not attended to when staff is taken away to retrieve lost documents, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is to implement a CMMS that preserves assets, keeps things running in optimum condition and helps ensure that assets will achieve their maximum life expectancy. These systems can also manage anticipated failures, allowing your staff to budget and plan while still saving time and money in the short and long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/V6p54jhODsE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>3 Important Benefits of CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/9/18/cddff5bd-0825-4046-88b8-174c9c150877_cmms.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 221px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Companies need many things in order to run properly, including cash flow, a well-oiled marketing and sales staff, and a good production team. One element that businesses, especially manufacturing companies, often overlook is management and maintenance software. That&amp;#39;s where computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and enterprise asset management (EAM) software comes in. These programs can help your organization run smoothly and save money. Following are some of the most important benefits of CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Increased Productivity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Good CMMS software not only will enable you to schedule preventive maintenance but also let you see instructions for a specific job, what is needed for the job and whether you have the parts on hand to complete the job. A CMMS should also be able to show other pertinent information including service histories, warranties, etc. In addition, some software packages offer extra features, such as the ability to configure and manage reports and key performance indicators for presentations. Most CMMS software on the market includes mobile data capability. This allows you to connect to the cloud for easy sharing and access from wherever you are for enhanced flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Longer Equipment Life&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No matter what kind of equipment or assets you have, they will require some sort of maintenance. Performing routine and preventive maintenance will help your equipment last longer and save you money in the long run. Regularly scheduled maintenance not only will result in longer equipment life but also fewer equipment purchases and replacements. CMMS software can lead to a decrease in unplanned repair costs by enabling you to see the repairs made to a component during its lifetime so you can decide if it should be replaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Less Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When a machine breaks down, downtime usually occurs while the machine is waiting to be fixed. This downtime can be even longer if all the parts required to fix the machine are not on hand. With CMMS software, you are alerted when parts need to be ordered before a machine breaks down so downtime is reduced. Being able to schedule and plan day-to-day maintenance also makes it easier on the maintenance team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the possibility of achieving less downtime, longer equipment life and increased productivity, CMMS can be a great investment for organizations looking to become more cost-effective and efficient. With all of these benefits, why wouldn&amp;#39;t you want CMMS to help run your company?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;

            <title>12 Ways to Use a Smartphone as a Maintenance Tool</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/30/4f1f2eb1-cd48-4d3d-ae64-7aa23cc4d643_Fotolia_67056912_S.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In the past few years, the cellphone has evolved from a humble gadget used to make calls and check emails into a sophisticated device with features and functionality that can transform the way maintenance is performed. Many organizations are already using Web-based computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software on their phones or tablets, allowing technicians to update work orders in real time as they perform work. This eliminates the need to take notes and re-enter them later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile CMMS enables technicians to access asset logs, meter-reading history, parts inventory and warranty information in the field as they work. Using mobile CMMS technology can also improve accuracy and efficiency by eliminating redundancy and reducing the time needed to manage work orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, a constant stream of new mobile technologies is fueling a fundamental shift in the way smartphones are used for maintenance. As a result, the modern smartphone could overtake the wrench as the tool of choice in the maintenance technician&amp;#39;s tool belt. The simple reason for this shift is the extraordinary technology inside your smartphone. Certain features and apps can turn your phone into a must-have maintenance gadget. They can enhance your CMMS experience or provide the tool needed to perform a task without having to search for specialist equipment or tools. Below are 12 such features and apps, although many more are also available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/30/c2ae24ce-4fb8-4e60-91df-170e14f1c157_CameraFunction.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 533px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;Use the camera functionality on your smartphone to upload images and videos directly to the asset record or work order in your CMMS. It can be difficult to describe an issue over the phone, so images and videos are a great way to document repairs. Senior technicians or factory support can review the work order images and videos from the office and recommend actions quickly. In the future, technicians can review the work order videos and images when faced with similar issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Voice Recognition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Modern smartphones come with built-in voice recognition software, such as Apple&amp;#39;s Siri. Technicians can fill in work order details by simply talking into their phone. This saves time when entering large amounts of work order information into the CMMS. Rather than using a small keyboard, simply dictate repair actions into the built-in microphone and include them on the work order record. While cellphone speech recognition is not 100-percent foolproof, it is getting better. Soon we&amp;#39;ll do less talking through our phones and more talking to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Barcode and Quick Response Code Scanning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/30/20a0e176-6d5d-4d85-88d1-0480254148df_QR-Code-Image.jpeg" style="width: 200px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Some CMMS vendors integrate barcode and quick response (QR) code-scanning capabilities into their mobile app to convert your smartphone into a scanning device. After scanning a QR code or barcode with a smartphone, technicians are taken directly to the asset, part or work order record in the CMMS. This saves time navigating through long lists of items in the CMMS. Technicians can update asset records, enter condition states, log meter readings and flag necessary alerts quickly and easily. Also, unregistered CMMS users can scan codes on equipment, walls or doors to be taken to the guest request form where they can log an issue against the asset. By scanning the code on the asset, the maintenance manager then knows exactly which issue to address on a particular asset. To see how it works, view this &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXj3qppTqJY"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or visit &lt;a href="http://www.maintenanceassistant.com/cmms"&gt;www.maintenanceassistant.com/cmms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Near Field Communications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smartphones enabled with near field communications (NFC) can be used to identify assets through radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags. RFID tags can be purchased for a few cents and placed on assets throughout the facility. By tapping their phone against the RFID tag, users are taken directly to the asset record in the CMMS where they can log their issue. Alternatively, NFC and RFID technology can be used to provide proof of presence for safety-related work orders. The tapping motion is recorded digitally, proving the technician was physically at the asset when the work order was completed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Maps and GPS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/30/36254583-1c21-46d6-b278-2250187733ac_GPS-Maps.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 533px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;The majority of smartphones come with maps and GPS technology, allowing you to use satellites to pinpoint the latitude and longitude coordinates of your current location to within a few feet. This enables technicians to locate dispersed assets in the field without the need to search through reams of outdated maps. A maps app can guide you to the work order asset in your CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Flashlight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Need to look into a dark corner inside a machine? Don&amp;#39;t forget that you can use the camera flash on a smartphone as a flashlight to illuminate the area of interest. There are also many flashlight apps available for your smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Unit Measurement Converter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you can&amp;#39;t convert meters to feet in your head, download a unit measurement converter app. These apps are ideal for quick conversions in the maintenance shop or out in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Strobe Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Strobe lights (or stroboscopes) can be used to study the behavior of rotating, oscillating or vibrating equipment. They are often employed as tachometers to accurately calculate the running speed of belts and motors. The technician adjusts the frequency of the strobe until the belt or motor appears to freeze. At this point, the speed of the motor can be calculated and adjusted if necessary. A stroboscope can also be used for balancing, verifying alignment and checking for looseness. There are a number of apps that turn the camera flash into a stroboscope. Simply search your app store for &amp;ldquo;stroboscope&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;strobe tachometer&amp;rdquo; to download and test for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Vibration Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In predictive maintenance applications, vibration analysis can help identify bearing defects, shaft misalignment, imbalance and structural resonant frequencies. Sensors are embedded in the equipment or technicians use meters to monitor vibration at regular intervals and report vibration readings in real time. Modern smartphones have a built-in accelerometer or gyroscope that can be used for vibration analysis on pumps and motors. For example, the three-channel accelerometer in the iPhone is sensitive enough to analyze the vibration of moving machinery. Simply turn on the app, place your smartphone on the asset to be measured and start recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Magnetic Field Detector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your smartphone comes with magnetic field sensors to determine magnetic north. Several developers have designed magnetic field detector apps that can be used to measure magnetic fields around the smartphone. The apps use the embedded magnetic sensors in the smartphone to turn it into an electromagnetic field (EMF) meter. These apps are ideal for simple tasks like checking for power lines behind drywall. However, use a proper Gaussmeter if you need exact measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Metal Detector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/7/30/9d5758e0-311e-430f-b86b-e47c887c1eb1_Metal-Detector.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 533px; margin: 7px; float: right;" /&gt;The magnetic field sensors in your smartphone can also be used to detect metal objects. The strength of the magnetic field increases as the smartphone is brought into close contact with metal. The metal detector apps can be used for a variety of applications like locating metal studs in walls and iron pipes in the ground.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Sound Level Meters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sound level meters measure the level of sound intensity in decibels at any point in time. A number of apps can convert your smartphone into a basic sound pressure meter. These apps use complex Fourier transform algorithms and the smartphone&amp;#39;s built-in microphone to measure noise in decibels. The apps are limited by the hardware on the phone, so it may be difficult to measure in extreme cases. However, they are reliable and accurate enough for non-critical applications. If you need precision accuracy, buy a proper sound pressure level (SPL) meter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile CMMS has the ability to transform the way maintenance is performed by providing instant access to the CMMS database from any Internet connection. Those who have embraced mobile CMMS continually sing its praises. It&amp;#39;s now time to take it to the next level by using some of the advanced features and functionality as outlined above. With a plethora of maintenance-related apps now available, you can make your smartphone a crucial maintenance tool. While the apps are not 100-percent accurate yet, they can give you the precision needed for simple jobs. Just be sure you have your smartphone charged and in your pocket so it will be ready when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/1mNpxCKqsDA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why Training is Key for CMMS Implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/6/19/45786d87-9778-45ff-a71a-b19896e4100a_training_class1.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 287px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Approximately 70 percent of all computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) implementations fail primarily due to poor data and lack of training. Proper training cannot be overemphasized when bringing a new CMMS system into an organization, as it is key to enhancing the skills of employees and expanding their knowledge base, leading to improvements in efficiency, productivity and performance. Here are some of the many advantages of CMMS training:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Adoption&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training increases user adoption, which is critical when implementing any software program. Personnel are more likely to accept the system and use it from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Time and Money&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not properly trained, personnel waste valuable hours trying to learn the system on company time. Training demonstrates best practices when setting up and configuring the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Uniformity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training ensures personnel are all equally proficient on the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Speed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It can take hours to figure out how to perform one simple function within a CMMS software program. Training means a quicker CMMS roll-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training outlines best practices when entering data on a day-to-day basis. This data can be used to streamline maintenance processes, improve labor productivity and refine the supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Insight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training helps the user implement the system more effectively and efficiently. With training, technicians and supervisors will better understand and be able to take full advantage of the program&amp;#39;s many features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Commitment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Training reinforces management&amp;#39;s commitment to making the CMMS work within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With proper training, employees gain a better understanding of not only how to use the CMMS effectively but also why they are using it. Well-trained administrators can deploy the CMMS within their maintenance organization quickly, efficiently and effortlessly, just as well-trained maintenance technicians can use the CMMS to its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CMMS users need to be trained on workflow, CMMS administration, report generation, data extraction and data analysis. Otherwise, it will become a daily data-entry exercise where garbage in equals garbage out and eventually the CMMS fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When considering a CMMS, be sure to inquire about the training options. Most vendors provide onsite or online training. Others offer video tutorials, training workshops or recorded webinars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keep in mind that training is an ongoing process throughout the lifetime of the CMMS. Send your maintenance team to refresher webinars and knowledge-transfer workshops to help reinforce best practices. During training workshops, attendees may become aware of certain modules and features that could be deployed in their organizations to make their workflow more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you choose free or paid training options, invest in the time upfront to get your employees properly trained, because training makes the difference between CMMS success and failure. Your technicians and maintenance supervisors will be the ones using the CMMS on a daily basis, so they need to know what they are doing from the start. With the proper training, your CMMS can become an invaluable tool to your organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/A8kX-ZIldLI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Verticalization is Transforming EAM </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/4/2/44116c14-9dd6-4ec4-be68-8448849fc8bd_Verticalization.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 144px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;In the past, organizations looking to implement asset management initiatives could choose between two types of enterprise asset management (EAM) solutions. There were one-size-fits-all systems that provided a wide range of features but often delivered shallow functionality that failed to meet in-depth requirements. The second option was to deploy a group of specialized applications that could better address deeper functionality needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most organizations selected the latter path to avoid the lacking capabilities of a generic solution. However, the use of multiple non-integrated applications led to separation between data and processes. Thus, the siloed mentality was born. Organizations accepted this way of thinking because it presented the best option to meet their asset management needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The End of Monolithic EAM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With modern developments for EAM technology, subscribing to the siloed approach is no longer necessary. Today&amp;#39;s EAM solutions have been significantly affected by the wave of verticalization currently transforming the enterprise software space. Applications are now developed with built-in flexibility to enable easy configuration while still delivering critical basic functionality such as document and energy management, asset tracking, and the ability to manage multiple classes of assets. Organizations can purchase an EAM system and tailor it to address their specific requirements without having to rewrite any of the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These new configurable, verticalized EAM solutions benefit organizations by facilitating faster implementation and ultimately helping to lower costs. With the necessary functionality to better meet industry-specific challenges, the necessity for pricey customizations is significantly reduced. Businesses now have the opportunity to utilize a consolidated, end-to-end asset management system that better supports their needs whether they are an industrial manufacturer or a wastewater treatment plant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The New Enterprise Outlook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Verticalization has served as the catalyst for a new way of thinking about asset management. Long gone are the days when businesses simply accept the information silos and disparate workflows that slow critical processes. Companies are realizing that integrating EAM as a part of daily operations, rather than viewing asset management as a separate practice, can greatly benefit their organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By incorporating a verticalized EAM solution with other critical business systems, decision-makers can create a more holistic view of their enterprise. This facilitates greater visibility and collaboration across departments and allows for more in-depth analysis of resource allocation and costs. Users have greater insight into how assets are impacting and being impacted by other day-to-day activities, which facilitates better, more informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a maintenance manager utilizes his organization&amp;#39;s EAM application to determine how much it costs to run each individual asset. He knows which assets require more investment because of their energy use and which ones have a higher price tag because they are not functioning at optimum efficiency. However, because the organization&amp;#39;s EAM application lacks interoperability with the accounting system, members of the accounting department only have insight into total costs. Without connectivity into their EAM application or drill-down capabilities, financial decision-makers might wrongly assume that the most costly assets are the most inefficient simply because they only have a surface-level perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a verticalized, integrated EAM solution was employed, these users would be able to see what the maintenance manager already knows &amp;ndash; that the greatest inefficiency is not necessarily synonymous with the largest expense. This lack of insight could lead to potentially costly, ineffective business decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By approaching asset management with an enterprise mentality, organizations can have greater insight into how assets are affecting their bottom line. In a time when shrinking budgets and resources have become commonplace challenges, this enables leadership to pinpoint areas where costs and environmental impact can both be reduced.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/vh6uMrMFBqE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Advantages of Cloud-based CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/26/c5be18ce-7d7c-4339-a233-c17af94a03db_cloud-computing.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 189px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;The advantages of computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) software are well-documented in thousands of maintenance books and Internet articles. However, the benefits of cloud-based CMMS over traditional on-premise systems are less well-known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cloud or hosted software means the software is available over the Internet, whereas on-premise software is downloaded and installed on local computers or servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cloud software continues to make headlines as the next evolution of the software industry. Faster Internet speeds, cheaper database storage and the dawn of the smartphone and tablet era have made cloud-based software delivered over the Internet a viable option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cloud CMMS applications offer the same level of functionality as traditional on-premise systems but with a number of additional benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Faster Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With cloud-based CMMS software, you can be up and running in 60 seconds. Once you register, you receive instant access to your CMMS. No time is wasted waiting for a CD to arrive, configuring hardware, installing the software, etc. It is all done automatically with cloud CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No IT-related Costs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cloud-based CMMS software is hosted on the vendor&amp;#39;s servers so there are no costs relating to server hardware and maintenance, operating system licensing, network configuration or information technology (IT) support. You make use of your existing IT infrastructure such as computers, tablets and mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Access Anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cloud-based CMMS can be accessed from any Internet connection anywhere in the world. There is no need to configure firewalls and grant access to certain Internet protocol (IP) addresses when users are at home or on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile technology is changing the way businesses work today. Tablets and smartphones are the must-have business accessory as they increase efficiency and productivity like never before. That means spending less time in front of the computer and more time on the front lines. This is great news for maintenance technicians who need instant access to their CMMS in the field as they complete their work. Most CMMS mobile apps can be accessed on any mobile device, so no expensive handheld hardware is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Weekly System Updates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Keeping your software up to date is crucial. Software updates offer new features, improvements and workflows that continually increase your efficiency. Upgrades also introduce patches, fixes and security updates that address any bugs in the system. With cloud-based software, updates are included in the subscription and occur automatically every weekend so you always have the latest version of the CMMS at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Managed Database&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With on-premise software, you must back up your database to another server at regular intervals or risk losing all your important CMMS data if your hard drive fails on your server or computer. This includes all your asset and work-order history. With cloud-based CMMS software, managed backups are included in the subscription price. Cloud CMMS providers store the data on redundant servers in multiple locations, protecting you from hardware failures and even natural disasters. Many promise more than 99-percent uptime so you can be sure your CMMS will be available when you need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Database Security&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the responsibility of the cloud CMMS vendors or their hosting provider. They are responsible for data protection, anti-virus updates, secure logins and data encryption. This gives you peace of mind knowing your data is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	24/7 Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With on-premise software, if the server goes down, you must wait until your IT guy can get it running again. If this happens over the weekend, the CMMS could be down for hours at a time. Cloud-hosted CMMS applications reside on servers that are monitored around the clock. The servers typically are co-located in facilities that house other Internet applications, so the costs of monitoring can be spread across the entire customer base. Technicians are onsite and ready to get servers up and running again quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are considering upgrading or implementing a CMMS for the first time, cloud-based software provides distinct advantages and cost savings over traditional on-premise software. The reliability, mobility and lower total cost of ownership that comes with cloud-based CMMS can give you the competitive advantage you need to take your asset management strategy to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/Si-vNTsFiuQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Make Asset Data More Useful </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The benefits and overriding value of a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS)/enterprise asset management (EAM) application have remained consistent over time, but the technology behind these systems has seen dramatic changes. With blitzing speed, it seems technology innovations are occurring almost daily. Everyone benefits since this usually translates to improvements with communication tools and software applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today&amp;#39;s CMMS/EAM solutions are designed to capture, track and manage real-time information according to the needs of your plant or facility. The sophistication of these systems also means you have the capacity to generate enormous amounts of data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what about this data? By default, data is nothing more than static information unless you use it for improvement purposes or to sustain your operations. The data generated by your CMMS/EAM system can actually be telling you quite a bit of information. The question is are you leveraging this data for anything beyond the basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mining the Nuggets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In most cases, there is a goldmine of statistical data that can be mined from your CMMS/EAM and developed into highly intelligent information. Through graphically presented data in dashboard views, key performance indicators (KPIs) can provide you with an immediate snapshot of critical performance areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determining your KPIs and what to do with them requires that you first establish your organizational objectives of what you want to accomplish with these data views. Generally, an organization is going to want their KPIs to assist them with analysis for more efficient decision-making in the areas of cost reductions, planning, forecasting, budgeting and resource needs. Your CMMS/EAM will generate this data in a visual dashboard graphic based on the KPIs you develop. Popular KPIs often track the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance costs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Planned maintenance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Preventive maintenance (PM) schedule compliance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Critical equipment availability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mean time between failures (MTBF)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance backlog&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Overtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Rework&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) inventory turns&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment downtime&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key is to set objectives that help determine what KPIs are important to your plant or facility. They need to be specific to your operations so that proper analysis can be made and action taken to address areas where performance issues arise. That&amp;#39;s when your data is telling you something you need to know. This is where the analysis and decision-making opportunities exist. It is also where you can create &amp;quot;what-if&amp;quot; scenarios to base decisions on intelligent data generated by your CMMS/EAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The activity of setting KPI objectives and defining what will be measured should be aligned with those who have decision-making authority. What information is critical for management to know? What dashboard views must be available for different levels of management? What does the maintenance department need to see versus plant management? These are all good questions to ask and should be considered at the onset of identifying which data to measure and how to present it. If it isn&amp;#39;t important to your operation, don&amp;#39;t create a KPI. While that concept may seem simple, you don&amp;#39;t want to waste your time and effort with insignificant measures. The point is to measure what matters and what has the greatest operational impact on the plant, facility, equipment and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the measurement objectives have been established and the KPIs developed, you will have an active dashboard allowing users to analyze and act on crucial data reporting. Those in management positions will have real-time information available for efficient and insightful decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2014/2/19/ca2c9d92-049d-43f5-90cd-a9c9d3e8a6cd_Dashboard-View-2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 368px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Visual Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most dashboards can be custom-designed to present data in graphs, charts, tables and as gauges. Often color codes are used to indicate whether performance levels are within acceptable standards or have fallen below them. Additionally, many data intelligence tools will allow you to adjust your KPIs and build measurements to suit the specific needs of a department, division or the entire plant. This means that certain KPIs many not need to be displayed for everyone. A maintenance manager is going to be chiefly concerned about KPIs that have immediate impact on his area of responsibility and whether performance goals are being met. At the same time, a plant manager likely will be looking for trends and areas of operational significance across the entire plant or facility. Setting up dashboard views based on user level and responsibilities is essential for providing real-time visuals of performance. Doing so allows the user to know immediately if any action is required to address a particular situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the organization gains additional insights from the dashboards, trends will emerge that provide intelligence in critical operating areas. For example, your PM schedule compliance KPI will graphically indicate whether you are meeting stated goals through a trend analysis view. Similarly, your equipment performance KPI will indicate availability and failure rates depending on how the measurement is established. Corrective actions can then be taken as required. Comparisons can also be made to different operating periods to determine if any trends exist or noticeable relationships appear through different measurements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With these types of views, in-depth analysis can be performed to establish whether adjustments are required. Consideration is given to the replacement or repair of equipment and the cost impact of operations. These insights are critical for sustaining efficient operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Measure with Purpose&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Analyzing your CMMS/EAM data should be done with purpose. Knowing what the dashboards are actually telling you is imperative. It&amp;#39;s easy to misinterpret or act out of haste without first gathering all the necessary data for an informed decision. Measurements can also change over time as priorities shift within a department or even plant-wide. This could pertain to new maintenance initiatives, a revised production process or even a new corporate mandate. Whatever your circumstances, be sure to measure and analyze data that has specific influence on achieving stated goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Better Decision-making&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Viewing the data generated by your CMMS/EAM in the form of graphically presented KPIs will allow for informed analysis in the areas of cost reductions, planning, forecasting, budgeting, resource needs and efficiency. You may even have to occasionally revisit why certain KPIs were established and why certain data is being analyzed. Avoid the trap of doing things the same way. Revisit priorities often and make sure your KPIs are measuring meaningful areas of your plant operational performance. Collaborate with departments and divisions as a way to share insights and develop necessary action plans that will ultimately result in company-wide efficiency gains. Top management will want to see these types of continuous-improvement activities, and your KPI dashboard views will serve as the leverage point for intelligent decision-making. Put your CMMS/EAM data to work to obtain the operational results your company needs for a competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/sozMJv8bfac" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Creating Competitive Advantages with CMMS Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The modern manufacturing business is located in multiple locations throughout the world to get close to target markets or to take advantage of local talent or natural resources. As an organization grows to additional locations or acquires its competitors, the number of moving parts increases, creating inefficiencies that can impact the bottom line. This includes different processes, cultural thinking and information technology (IT) systems that prevent the organization from scaling efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One consequence of an expanding global footprint is the various computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) applications installed across the organization. These disparate solutions place obvious limits on extendibility, scalability and effectiveness of the CMMS, which result in business process inefficiencies, IT software management challenges and a lack of communication and collaboration across the organizations maintenance teams. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Challenges of Disparate CMMS Systems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Productivity, Workflow and Process Inconsistency &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Different sites manage maintenance in their own way, so the most efficient way of working is not commonplace across the organization. As a result, inefficient processes lead to a reduction in productivity and human error. Additional resources may be required to manage process inefficiency across disparate systems, which in turn leads to additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Tardy Visibility Across the Organization &amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;In today&amp;#39;s fast-paced environment, the right decisions need to be made quickly. Continuous improvement is dependent on the ability to analyze what has happened in the past so changes can be made going forward. It takes longer to pull data across the organization from multiple CMMS systems for analysis. Countless hours are spent trying to tie information from disparate systems together to measure business performance and make informed decisions. It may seem like comparing apples to oranges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Spiraling IT Costs &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With so many disparate CMMS systems, IT wastes an enormous amount of time dealing with different databases, interfaces, update schedules, security, replacement cycles and license agreements. Managing multiple CMMS systems can be an IT logistical nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Customer Loyalty &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Maintenance doesn&amp;#39;t just affect asset availability; it affects all aspects of business including customer service, product quality, energy efficiency and ultimately the bottom line. Customer loyalty will fluctuate from location to location as levels of service and product quality vary from site to site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Redundant Parts Inventory &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;A spare part becomes redundant when it exceeds its useful life. This is common in organizations with different CMMS and/or parts systems. It is difficult to determine which parts in which locations can be used elsewhere or sold, so these parts remain on shelves far beyond their useful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Standardizing technology across an organization is key to eliminating silos, reducing costs, maximizing productivity from staff, keeping customers happy and getting your organization on a steady growth path. When it comes to maintenance, moving to a single enterprise-wide CMMS drives out redundancy and leads to a number of advantages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Advantages of Enterprise-wide CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Easy Access to Data &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;You cannot improve what you cannot measure, so data is the lifeblood of an organization. With a single enterprise-wide CMMS, maintenance-related data can be pulled instantly online for one or more locations. Asset managers and production planners can use this to make informed decisions that improve the organization&amp;#39;s overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reduced IT Costs &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ndash; &lt;/strong&gt;Software uniformity across the business reduces the IT hardware and software costs required to maintain numerous disparate CMMS applications. By centralizing your IT efforts in one CMMS application, you can reduce the resources needed to support, maintain, train, upgrade and renew multiple preventive-maintenance software systems. A single CMMS frees up valuable IT resources and time that can be used elsewhere to make the business more efficient and profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Process Efficiency &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Implementing a uniform best-practice way of working through standardized operating procedures ensures personnel at all locations are performing maintenance tasks in the most efficient manner. This reduces overhead and human error, improves quality, increases customer satisfaction, decreases costs and drives growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Easy Reporting &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With an enterprise-wide CMMS, you can compare the performance of different sites using advanced reports. This gives better visibility on where to focus your efforts and do things better, thus improving the organization&amp;#39;s overall performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Organizational Culture &amp;ndash;&lt;/strong&gt;Standardizing technology helps create a more uniform organizational culture where every technician uses the same software and procedures to perform their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Best Practices Through Improved Communication &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;When managers and technicians complete a work order and fill in all required fields, they are in effect sharing their expertise in the CMMS. Over time, this knowledge captured in the CMMS is transferred to other employees throughout the organization regardless of location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Shared Inventory &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;With multi-site CMMS, inventory is shared across the organization so technicians can search the entire parts database. For older equipment, parts may not be readily available or may need to be custom-built. Therefore, it may be more cost-effective and timely to get a part shipped from another site rather than order a new replacement from the supplier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Supply Chain &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;When each site uses its own CMMS system, maintenance managers may order the same parts from different suppliers. Organizations using a multi-site CMMS can order parts from a single supplier and get them shipped and billed to different sites, thus taking advantage of bulk discounts and minimizing administration time processing parts orders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Compliance &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Enterprise-wide CMMS helps provide a centralized view of compliance across the organization. If everyone is working the same way and using the same standardized operating procedures, compliance managers can be sure the organization is ready for audits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Health and Safety &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Standardizing the way work is performed through one CMMS system reduces the chances of safety-related incidents. Procedures and operating manuals can be uploaded directly to the CMMS so users have access to safety-related information on the production floor. Lockout/tagout steps can be automatically populated on each work order if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Simply put, one enterprise-wide CMMS is cheaper and more efficient than many disparate systems. Enterprise-wide CMMS software helps enforce a common way of working across the organization while streamlining maintenance processes. A multi-site CMMS can help an organization standardize its maintenance while delivering significant cost savings through efficient use of resources. It can also free up employee time to complete more productive tasks that drive value to the bottom line. This macro harmonization across the organization results in simplified internal maintenance processes, greater reliability, higher quality production, improved consumer confidence and ultimately sustained competitive advantage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/6Wrwv2CEA2w" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Report Finds Mobile CMMS Deployment Increases Satisfaction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to a recent survey, users of computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) software are more effective and more satisfied with their systems&amp;#39; overall quality and features than professionals who use custom or enterprise suite software systems to manage maintenance projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2013 CMMS UserView report, which was conducted by Software Advice, compiled responses from more than 100 maintenance professionals to discover how effectively software is being used within the maintenance field while gauging adoption, feature satisfaction, future investment plans, top benefits and challenges encountered by maintenance-management software users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations unable to purchase stand-alone CMMS software, the survey found that enterprise asset management (EAM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) software with maintenance-management capabilities were the next most effective technology utilized by maintenance professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At a minimum, companies should ensure they have some kind of software application in place that can assist with the management of maintenance projects, as the report showed that professionals who use some type of software obtain better results than professionals who do not use any software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent years, mobile functionality has been a leading differentiator for maintenance software vendors, but it is now expected by many professionals evaluating new systems. Vendors should continue to invest in mobile application development and focus on improving their offering, as the survey found mobile support leads to highly satisfied users. Interestingly, 13 percent of respondents were unaware if their systems supported mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Maintenance software vendors should be focused on developing feature-rich and easy-to-use mobile applications if they want happy customers,&amp;quot; said Michael Koploy, managing editor at &lt;a href="http://www.softwareadvice.com/cmms/"&gt;Software Advice&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;The increasing user demand for mobile software, as well as continuing efforts by CMMS vendors to develop better mobile applications, will increase the penetration of mobile technology in this space.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey participants were asked to complete a 20-question poll online. Approximately 116 maintenance professionals responded. Sixteen percent of the respondents worked in oil, gas, mining or metals industries, which was the largest segment represented in the survey. Nearly one-third (31 percent) of the professionals sampled were employed by companies with more than 500 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Automating Maintenance Tasks with CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/7/17/3e1bfe15-2f5d-40f3-9723-633fc7adf5c6_Blend Tanks-small.jpeg" style="width: 350px; height: 233px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;The boiler at the Tulco Oils plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has never gone out of service &amp;ndash; and the company wants to keep it that way. That&amp;rsquo;s why this midsized manufacturer of industrial lubricants invested in a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) when it embarked on a multimillion-dollar expansion project that added 15,000 square feet to its main plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tulco Oils chose Bigfoot CMMS, produced by Smartware Group Inc., to automate maintenance tasks for the new machinery installed during the plant&amp;rsquo;s expansion, including seven new blending tanks, 50 pumps and an air-compression system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With the increase in the number of key components in the expanded plant, we needed a CMMS for work orders and preventive maintenance (PM) management to schedule ongoing maintenance and downtime,&amp;quot; said Don Stanton, Tulco Oils&amp;rsquo; vice president of operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the expansion, the company also had to automate maintenance processes for the plant&amp;rsquo;s existing gas, air, boiler and steam systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We added a load to those systems that made it even more critical for every piece of equipment to be well-maintained,&amp;quot; Stanton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a designed lubricant manufacturer, Tulco Oils custom blends a broad array of hydraulic and gear oils, transformer oils, turbine oils and cutting fluids used to build equipment sold to original equipment manufacturers &amp;ndash; from tractors that plow Midwestern farms to machines that produce consumer goods in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, it can take from three to seven days for Tulco Oils to fill orders and deliver its products to customers. However, some local customers have sent out emergency calls for help in one afternoon and taken delivery of lubricants the next morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Often we have to respond to a customer&amp;rsquo;s emergency,&amp;quot; Stanton said. &amp;quot;If a customer has a failed piece of equipment and comes to us with an urgent need to get the oil to repair the broken product, we respond immediately. The giant brands make no such claims about these quick turnarounds.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When expanding its plant, the company used the opportunity to redesign its maintenance operations and configure the CMMS program to fit its specific needs. Instead of using a standard-issue database template, the Tulco Oils team worked with Smartware Group to design an equipment database that matched the company&amp;rsquo;s asset-management needs and captured the most relevant information for the industrial lubricant market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t have off-the-shelf products,&amp;quot; Stanton noted. &amp;quot;We don&amp;rsquo;t stock products because it&amp;rsquo;s impossible to keep on hand all the different combinations specified by our customers. We custom blend our oils and lubricants for specific orders.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because quick turnaround time is the linchpin of the company&amp;rsquo;s competitive advantage, Stanton underscored the importance of keeping equipment at Tulco Oils&amp;rsquo; expanded plant in shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;If a boiler were to go down, it would kill our ability to blend products,&amp;quot; Stanton said. &amp;quot;The same goes for the air compressor. We have an air dryer on the system because oil and water do not mix, so the air must remain dry. We have to make sure these pieces of machinery work every single day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prior to adopting the CMMS program, staff members kept a paper trail to track service calls and maintenance tasks for its equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We didn&amp;rsquo;t operate off of memory, but we used lots of handwritten records and logs,&amp;quot; Stanton recalled. &amp;quot;The more machinery we added, the more impossible it became to manage. We needed a better method for creating preventive maintenance schedules.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, thanks to the new CMMS, the operations team at Tulco Oils no longer relies on handwritten work orders. Instead, the CMMS automatically produces email reminders that go to whoever is responsible for the maintenance task &amp;ndash; whether that person is a technician on staff or an outside vendor. The system is also designed to avoid email spam to make the process even more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;One big benefit we&amp;rsquo;re getting from our CMMS system is better communication about maintenance,&amp;quot; Stanton added. &amp;quot;When a piece of equipment is not operational, we can tap in and create a work order without having to run someone down or spend time trying to contact someone by phone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also used the CMMS to set up a non-asset PM calendar, including occupational and environmental safety checks, such as for water contamination analysis and prevention, as well as other municipal safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With an expanded plant and increased capabilities provided by its CMMS, Stanton foresees his company gaining even more clout in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Now we can run circles around our competitors,&amp;quot; he said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/Tnavmw6Cweo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Benefits of Mobile Maintenance Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/21/27b808d7-670a-4085-8147-2bdbbbd00b68_mobile device-2.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 316px; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; " /&gt;Mobile interfaces for enterprise asset management (EAM) software and computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) have been around for a long time but have managed to penetrate only a very small number of organizations. Some of the reasons for this are technological. Some are cultural, and some are a combination of the two. While &lt;a href="http://download.ifsworld.com/home/if1/page_917/mobility_in_eam_software_study.html"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; suggests that acceptance of mobile EAM and CMMS has been slow, interest is increasing in this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, the cost of handheld devices has come down precipitously. Handhelds are now available in various shapes and sizes, ranging from ruggedized devices to a simple consumer smartphone running the Android or iOS interfaces. Many companies have also redesigned their mobile interfaces to take advantage of new devices, operating systems and the lessons learned from earlier interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Given the mission-critical nature of many capital assets in sectors like oil and gas, power generation, aerospace, defense and others, the idea of greater efficiency and improved real-time visibility into the state of assets and the activities of technicians is appealing. This means that asset-intensive organizations can realize important and measurable benefits by crossing any remaining technological or cultural barriers to a mobile EAM solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduced Downtime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The role of an executive in charge of significant productive assets like process manufacturing facilities, offshore oil rigs or nuclear power plants is to maximize the value realized from the capital asset while controlling cost. Any asset will experience at least some incremental downtime or loss of capacity during predictive or preventive maintenance work, refits or lifecycle extensions. In these situations or in a break-fix scenario, the faster work can be completed, the faster the piece of equipment or asset can return to productive use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the main places to take up slack in these activities is to speed up communication. As the maintenance route changes, the technician being notified through a mobile work-order application does not need to go back to a central office or scheduling board to see that the order of his work has been adjusted. This saves time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once at the machine to be serviced, if the technician can identify which parts ought to be replaced, check their availability in inventory and have them sent to him by using a mobile EAM interface, time is shaved off the repair process, which in turn gets the machine back into productive use more quickly.&amp;nbsp;This efficiency improvement potential is even greater when managing more extensive and multi-faceted asset management projects with multiple dependencies and concurrent activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improved Project Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For most asset-intensive companies, projects are the cornerstone of the business. Managing projects of various sizes and complexity is often the key to success. However, companies still struggle with fragmented business solutions that lack integration, making a plant shutdown, a refit of a production line or repairing and overhauling a jet or marine engine difficult to manage. Even with powerful back-end project management functionality, it can be difficult to manage a project in real time because maintenance technicians are recording work performed well after the fact &amp;ndash; at the end of the day when they are back at a computer. This means that work is often not recorded or recorded inaccurately so front office personnel cannot determine what is going on with a project in real time, which in turn slows down the ability to execute against a project plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In an EAM solution designed for this environment, the project drives activities, ensuring high-level visibility and transparency throughout the enterprise value chain. Mobility adds value to projects by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Allowing work to be recorded in real time as it is performed so project managers have immediate visibility into what is being accomplished.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Making revisions immediately available to individuals working on projects to avoid work on the wrong revision.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increasing engagement with the enterprise system. The more information winds up attached to the project record, the better a project manager will be able to marshal the appropriate resources.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Asset Integrity Control&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assets are often critical not just for their productive capacity but also because failures can result in environmental damage, loss of life and litigation. In these situations, you need more than maintenance &amp;mdash; you need the advanced discipline of asset integrity management (AIM). This not only means that regularly scheduled maintenance must be performed, but the readiness and serviceability of the asset must be documented on a very granular level. Mobility adds value to an AIM program by:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Enhancing usability so work performed is captured in the EAM system more accurately and completely.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Delivering automated routing information to maintenance technicians to increase the percentage of scheduled work performed and notifying them of emergent problems that need to be addressed immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Putting diagnostics, maintenance inventory and other data in the hands of technicians at the site of maintenance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Management by Walking Around&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Apps for handhelds are aimed at front-line technicians, but mobility is also important for administration and management. These power users of the EAM suite require a more robust EAM experience, including maintenance inventory functionality, human resources and even finance. They may use a full EAM suite on a tablet running Windows 8, if this is available from their EAM software vendor. The touchscreen format may be conducive for use during standing meetings and &amp;ldquo;management by walking around.&amp;rdquo; Again, this tablet usage should not be dependent on using a stripped down mobile app for Windows 8, as is the case for the app used by technicians. Instead, the full enterprise suite should be usable on a touchscreen device on the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Improved Communication/Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile devices are essentially communication tools that can provide solutions in several nontangible areas of the business. One problem confronted by many asset-intensive companies is the aging of the workforce. In the United States, for instance, the single largest generation of people was born between 1946 and 1964, and many of them will retire in the next 10 years. Mobile interfaces will prompt these knowledgeable workers and managers to interact more with the system, pulling more of their tribal knowledge into the enterprise application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobility will help address the aging workforce issue in other ways as well. Backfilling behind these retiring employees will be a challenge, as there is a dearth of industrial engineering and other maintenance-related graduates coming out of colleges and universities. Competition for this new generation of workers will be fierce, and a workplace with intuitive and modern technology will be more attractive than one hobbling along on various legacy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Google and mobile computing revolutions have affected us all, and we are all developing expectations for the computer technology we use. This next generation of workers will be much more demanding when it comes to technology and will expect the software they use every day to conform to their needs, rather than the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobility can address safety issues in several ways, with the most obvious being the real-time visibility of equipment condition and serviceability, and the resulting improvements in asset integrity management. However, mobile devices also are GPS-enabled, which can offer safety benefits in settings like mining and oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What to Look for in Mobile EAM&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The mobile interface and the EAM solution should be developed to work together. When selecting mobile EAM, look for an enterprise vendor that has developed and offers its own mobile interface. Using a third-party mobile interface will burden you with multiple contacts, contractual agreements and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The underlying EAM solution also needs to be developed as a full suite rather than as a bolt-on maintenance solution for an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application. Only when functions like finance, supply chain management, project management and human resources are integrated with the maintenance management functionality can you truly benefit from the real-time enterprise visibility mobile EAM has the potential to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bilateral visibility between maintenance and inventory/supply chain management is critical. The technician on the plant floor or at a work site ought to be able to see what inventory is available to determine if an asset can be returned to service immediately or must be taken offline. Parts managers and supply chain managers also need real-time visibility of parts demand so they can run the part to the technician or try to expedite acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mobile work orders and human resources functionality must also be integrated. This allows intelligent scheduling of available workers with full visibility of slated vacations, sicknesses, technical skills and certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, different mobile options must be available for different use cases, ranging from the technician on the plant floor walking a maintenance route to the plant manager marshaling resources and assigning tasks to the operations manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An investment in mobile EAM can drive both tangible and nontangible returns in any asset-intensive organization. Selecting the right EAM software and mobile options will reduce cost and complexity while increasing the return on investment. Mobile technology has improved, and the demands placed on the enterprise for real-time asset data suggest that now is the time to invest in this technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/vCLK3LlHaIc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Reduce Costs with MRO Data Cleansing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As competition and technology continue to evolve in today&amp;rsquo;s industrial and manufacturing industries, companies are faced with the ever-increasing challenge of reducing costs and improving efficiency while maintaining production quality. These manufacturing companies often have multiple sites spread across large geographic regions, each with thousands of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) spare parts on hand to keep operations running. In such large organizations, several different employees enter items into various enterprise asset management (EAM) systems at each site, with little or no standard guidelines, and often in multiple languages. Over time, this lack of standardization causes materials data to become inconsistent and inaccurate, resulting in many negative effects that can be felt throughout all units of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most common effects caused by corrupt materials data include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unidentifiable items&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Excess inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Duplication&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		False stock-outs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inefficient part searches&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased maverick purchases (direct buys)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Limited benefits from EAM systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These inefficiencies can cost companies significant time and money, while preventing them from making critical data-driven decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Data-Cleansing Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to transform corrupt data into consistent quality data, a data-cleansing process must be implemented to create one common corporate catalog that can be maintained throughout the entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the data-cleansing process may appear very simple in nature, it requires a very unique and specialized set of software, people and procedures. Some data-cleansing companies pride themselves on efficiency and speed through the use of automated software, but in reality, there is no software application that can accurately cleanse mass data files without human intervention. The data-cleansing process is actually much more detailed, and for the most accurate results, requires the use of automated software applications combined with the involvement of cleansing specialists to ensure consistency, accuracy and efficiency. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To illustrate the data-cleansing process from start to finish, it has been broken down into nine steps. While every project is different based on specific customer requirements, these nine steps cover the standard procedures involved in every data-cleansing project. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 1 &amp;ndash; Segregate and Standardize the Manufacturer Name and Part Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using automated software, the manufacturer name and part number are extracted and segregated from the unstructured free text description. Once segregated, the manufacturer name and part number are corrected and standardized, ensuring each unique manufacturer name and part number maintains one consistent structure throughout the entire database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/40bd5ebe-775e-4bcf-b3f8-61c255c76f6a_Figure 1.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 640px; height: 197px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 2 &amp;ndash; Assign Noun-Modifier and Required Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following the segregation and standardization of manufacturer names and part numbers, a noun-modifier dictionary is used to assign the correct identifier and descriptive properties for each item. As illustrated below, using the noun-modifier dictionary, each item is assigned a noun-modifier pair, where the noun is the primary identifier and the modifier is the secondary identifier. Each noun-modifier pair also contains on average five to seven associated attributes, which further describe the characteristics of that item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/3ea31df0-0dc4-4fb4-8050-b0b6972fb52d_Figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 238px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 3 &amp;ndash; Populate Attributes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After standardizing and populating information provided in the customer&amp;rsquo;s raw description, the remaining attributes are populated using internal and external tools such as the master parts library, which contains millions of pre-standardized items. An online research tool assists in the search and collection of additional part information. Using these powerful tools, item descriptions are accurately and efficiently enhanced with information retrieved directly from manufacturer catalogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 4 &amp;ndash; Assign Classification Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once all items have been correctly described by a noun, modifier and corresponding attributes, they can be assigned customer-specified classification codes. The classification codes are typically used for commodity segmentation, spend analysis and other custom reports, enabling companies to leverage purchases and gain insight for improved procurement-related efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 5 &amp;ndash; Identify Duplicate Items&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After cleansing and classification is complete, duplicate items within the database are identified by direct duplicate (same manufacturer name and part number) or by form-fit-function (different manufacturer name and part number but identical according to type, size and material). Once duplicates have been identified, they are assigned one common corporate part number, descriptions are duplicated to appear identical throughout the database, and the items are flagged for customer review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 6 &amp;ndash; Quality-Control Review&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due to the emphasis on quality and consistency, the next step involves a final human review of all items, typically conducted by an assigned project leader or dedicated quality-control person. The quality-control process ensures that every item follows proper format and nomenclature according to pre-defined customer standards, while verifying that enhanced descriptions are correct, accurate and complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 7 &amp;ndash; Send Review List to Customer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, 10 percent of the materials database is usually found to be review items, meaning items lacking critical information for accurate part identification such as manufacturer name or part number. During the data-cleansing process, these items are flagged and compiled into a customer review list. The review list is returned to the customer, who must then physically locate the item within the storeroom and record the necessary part information to be added into the material master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 8 &amp;ndash; Format Data to Customer ERP System&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the missing information has been collected for all review items and the entire cleansed database has been approved by quality control, it is deemed complete and transferred to the IT department. At this stage, IT specialists format the data to the customer-specified enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and extract it into a return file. The formatting stage is critical to achieving the desired end result, as every ERP system has its own unique layout, headers and field limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Step 9 &amp;ndash; Return Cleansed File&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the entire data file has been cleansed, standardized, enhanced, de-duplicated, reviewed and formatted to the customer&amp;rsquo;s ERP system, it is electronically delivered to the customer. At this time, the data can now be uploaded directly to the customer&amp;rsquo;s ERP system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Esthetically, the results of data cleansing are obvious, as the data now clearly maintains one consistent format and nomenclature throughout the entire organization while containing enhanced information for improved part identification. However, the real benefits are those that may not be as visually obvious but present the greatest return on investment. The most valuable benefits are those that come from the ability to identify and remove excess, obsolete and duplicate items while improving the ability to quickly search and locate parts when time is of the essence and minimizing equipment downtime is crucial. Key benefits include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Cost reduction&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification of excess-active and obsolete inventory&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identification and elimination of duplicate items&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of equipment downtime&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of maverick purchases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduction of expedited part orders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Improved maintenance efficiency&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Efficient part searches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Maximum ERP/EAM benefits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Improved reporting capabilities &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/4/24/0f22d95a-0f65-4ce1-9f14-dd689e5b0021_Figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 420px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From a long-term perspective, quality materials data is the key to maintaining operation costs and efficiencies. This process does not end once the data-cleansing project is complete. Maintaining ongoing data quality requires a strict set of catalog management procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency as new items are added and existing items are modified or suspended. Most data-cleansing companies offer some type of catalog management software or service for customers to maintain the quality of their cleansed catalog. However, unless the customer is able to dedicate an internal resource to manage the catalog, outsourcing this activity to the experts who originally cleansed the database will always deliver the best results.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Getting Better Returns from EAM Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Nobody implements enterprise asset management (EAM) software without an idea of what return they expect on the investment, but too often either due to the selection of inadequate software, subpar implementation or poorly articulated goals, EAM software projects do not deliver a measurable return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This article will examine a few of the specific ways that EAM software can deliver that sought-after return on investment (ROI) so you can plan your selection and implementation around these deliverables. These five tips should help you take advantage of the cost savings and revenue-enhancement features EAM has to offer while avoiding the pitfalls associated with an overly complex or problematic implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Reduced Maintenance Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	As is the case with other types of enterprise software, including enterprise resource planning, inventory reduction is a key area where EAM can deliver a return. Maintenance inventory is just like any other type of inventory. A balance must be struck between excess inventory that ties up capital and outages and downtime that result when a part, consumable or subassembly is required but not available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Maintenance inventory can be a real challenge to master because in most industrial environments some parts require a long lead-time and cannot be obtained on short notice. That heat exchanger, compressor or motor may be very specific to your individual piece of equipment. So during software selection and implementation, very close attention should be paid to purchasing functionality. Is the purchasing functionality robust enough for advanced and proactive inventory planning and management?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	For organizations with multiple locations, special attention should be paid to the extent that inventory can be optimized through standardized part identification and intersite planning. Oftentimes, different locations have different part-naming nomenclatures. Consider the challenge presented a plant manager by a high-value part like a motor that must be stocked at a level of about 0.2. He needs to stock at least one, but if numerous locations around a region require the same part, that one motor could be shared across locations, saving money and preventing unnecessary downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	So it should be no secret that inventory reduction is one way the right EAM software can deliver a measurable ROI to your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Manage Cash with Contract Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Potentially reducing cash tied up in parts is one way the EAM can deliver an ROI, but real-time cash management in general ought to be a top priority. Even when an asset is delivering a positive return in the intermediate term, business still operates on a month-by-month, quarter-by-quarter basis. Real-time information on what it costs to operate a plant or a portfolio of plant assets allows an executive to manage the present rather than adjust for the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	A significant portion of the variable cost of maintenance operations consists of the cost of contracts for supporting services and materials. EAM ought to take this into consideration and offer integrated contract management. Cash outlays necessary under each contract will be planned as the contract is finalized so cash-flow decisions can be made accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Some EAM packages allow you to open portals to suppliers like engineering firms and maintenance contractors. As you plan maintenance work for the weeks ahead, if your contractors have visibility of your plans through your EAM system, they can be informed of the upcoming work, schedule their people and ensure that they have the right tools and materials available. This also reduces the amount of time necessary to manage those outside contractors by phone and email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The lifecycle of a contract with a supplier should be encompassed entirely within the EAM application, starting with the call for bids on the project, acceptance of the bid and then the projected cash outlays and associated work performed by the contractor. This has benefits far beyond cash and contract management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This also means you save the time involved in entering the record of that work back into the EAM, enterprises resources planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance management (CMMS) software. Moreover, that real-time data could allow for more efficient use of the asset, as in the resumption of a production schedule immediately after a contractor finishes work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	It can also give management notification of when various milestones in a contracted project are completed &amp;ndash; milestones that may constitute liquidity events when the contractor is paid. The ability to track these liquidity events is crucial from a cash-management standpoint and contributes to ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Asset Integrity Management and Permitting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	EAM can drive cost and risk reduction by acting as a centralized location for all asset data over the entire asset lifecycle. Most managers instinctively know that an as-designed drawing of an asset is different from the as-built drawing. Similarly, the as-maintained drawing will be different from the as-built version. Changes are made during maintenance, refits, lifecycle extensions and repairs just as they are made during construction, and those changes need to be reflected in the asset management system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	An EAM software application should ideally be used to support asset design and construction, enabling the asset data to flow directly into the systems that will be used to sustain, maintain and operate the asset. This approach, known as &amp;ldquo;Design, Operate, Maintain,&amp;rdquo; really involves a single asset management system that supports the asset over its entire lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	The contract-management tools referred to in the section above have a role in true cradle-to-grave support because they ensure that the same enterprise system and data set is used regardless of who is making alterations to the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	EAM software must also include integrated permit and incident tracking. For a typical maintenance technician, this level of integration expedites the work that needs to be done and pulls information directly from the EAM system that is necessary to complete a formal work permit. Many EAM applications might not have such a tightly integrated permitting process, forcing technicians to take the time to use a separate system and creating a silo of data that is not reflected in your enterprise application.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Furthermore, someone may forget to get that permit and go into an enclosed area where there may have been a gas leak that was already reported. Eliminating death and disfigurement is certainly one more way EAM software can deliver ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Leverage Integrated Document Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In order to truly manage the asset lifecycle and maximize value realized from that tremendous capital investment, it is critical to have all of your asset data in a single repository. EAM software needs to have integrated document management so as assets are set up in the system, all of the relevant CAD drawings, contracts, maintenance schedules, testing reports and other documents are stored in a central repository. These individual documents must also be linked to the asset object in the EAM system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2013/2/21/ac16ec40-2a1e-45da-9467-f39e7f660378_Document Management.jpeg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Embedded document management with hooks into 3-D CAD drawings allows EAM to be the true central repository for asset data. Courtesy IFS North America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In a perfect EAM world, as process manufacturing equipment, oil and gas drilling equipment or other assets are commissioned, managers would be able to take the CAD serialized assets from the builder and pull them directly into their own EAM and document management system. Some EAM packages may be able to import the asset data but lack the hooks into CAD and 3-D CAD systems necessary to fully build those assets out into the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	This allows the EAM application to be the repository for all asset information over the asset lifecycle. Without that CAD integration, there is still a separate silo for a lot of key asset data that will hamper visibility and decision-making. This really is not in the true spirit of asset lifecycle management, which would keep all asset information together in an organized asset structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	So apart from ensuring adequate asset integrity management and compliance measures are in place, integrated document management delivers an ROI by reducing the time it takes to find, manage and update documents relating to the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Ease of Implementation and Usability Affect ROI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Fighting human nature is never a smart business strategy, and technicians and other front-line employees will not use a system that is confusing or presents functional barriers to their individual jobs. Therefore, ease of use is critical for an EAM software package. In addition, there is no way anyone can use a system until it has been implemented, so EAM software products that have a history of lengthy or failed implementations are to be avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	In many manufacturing environments, EAM software is a secondary or tertiary priority. There is an interest in increasing uptime and efficiency, but in industries like the chemical industry, nuclear power or oil and gas, it is a top priority because you cannot operate assets in a mission-critical environment without absolute control over asset integrity. In these industries, tracking maintenance work is not just about cost or even maximizing asset profitability. You need to be able to mitigate risks by preventing asset failures that could cost lives or cause environmental impacts. Maintenance is critical, and ensuring that the system used to manage and record maintenance work is just as critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	If EAM software is too convoluted and byzantine, maintenance technicians will not use it, which will present challenges as you will not have visibility into the state of the asset and may not complete essential scheduled maintenance projects. Even a manufacturer in a standard manufacturing environment will realize that an opportunity for ROI is lost if the software that has been licensed and implemented is not broadly used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	One way to increase ROI through usability is to deploy EAM functionality across mobile devices like tablets or through native apps for smartphones. This will allow technicians to update the system in real time, increasing visibility and reducing time spent at a terminal at the end of a shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	Opportunity for ROI is also increased, and that return can be realized sooner through an EAM application that allows a phased approach to implementation. There are mission-critical elements like work orders, document management to track the specifications of the asset as it is maintained and inventory that can be implemented immediately, allowing safe asset operation. Once that functionality is familiar and absorbed by the operation, additional functionality including permitting, health and safety and even full-blown reliability centered maintenance (RCM) functionality can be implemented.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	So it becomes clear that implementation and usability are both potential barriers to realizing ROI on an EAM software investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EAM can provide real and measurable cost savings and competitive advantages for companies that select the right set of applications and plan their implementations intelligently. In general, an implementation of EAM software that addresses more of the business functions that support the asset (contract management, inventory, document management and even human resources and finance) will offer a greater return than can be achieved by simply addressing maintenance needs. Care must also be taken to plan the implementation in such a way that it minimizes business disruption and leaves end users with a system they can use comfortably and capably.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>How to Modernize Maintenance Processes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s one thing to claim customer satisfaction in marketing literature and Web content. It&amp;#39;s another to achieve it by precisely measuring customer specifications and winning ISO 9000 certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Midland Metal Products (MMP) designs and fabricates permanent advertising display fixtures using sheet metal, wire and tubing for a vast array of consumer goods and products. As a fourth-generation supplier, MMP noticed that many of its processes had simply grown with the business. While going through certification audits, it became clear that the company needed to modernize its maintenance management process. Part of that certification process was to implement a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Measurements Count&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because MMP builds advertising displays for ad agencies that serve hundreds of consumer retail brands, it receives specifications from ad agencies to fabricate displays from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Because we do custom displays, we&amp;#39;re bringing to life fabrications that haven&amp;#39;t existed before,&amp;quot; said B.J. McDonald, MMP&amp;#39;s co-owner and facility director. &amp;quot;Erroneous measures can ruin the display. Therefore, our measuring tools have to give precise measurements.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To meet ISO standards, all 242 of MMP&amp;#39;s measuring tools &amp;mdash; from tape measurers to micrometers &amp;mdash; must be calibrated precisely to the customer&amp;#39;s measurement parameters. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The ISO 9001-2008 certification helped us look at our production system and come up with a precise process to do this one thing perfectly all the time &amp;ndash; from the moment you get the customer order to the end product the customer receives,&amp;quot; McDonald explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the close tolerances for MMP&amp;#39;s custom products, calibrating measurement devices was a major issue.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As part of our certification, ISO auditors looked at whether our measurement devices could fail,&amp;quot; McDonald said. &amp;quot;Bigfoot CMMS helped us win ISO certification.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before MMP installed its CMMS, the company had no way to adequately track or maintain any of its measurement devices. Today, MMP uses CMMS to schedule preventive maintenance (PM) for every measurement device used in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, by employing CMMS to issue daily PMs, MMP shows ISO auditors and customers that the company is working within the tolerances of its market. According to ISO standards, each device must have a certificate of calibration to get the designation. This is one area where the company simply cannot miss a PM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Maintenance Matters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MMP not only uses CMMS for measurement devices but also for its entire plant. Within its 110,000-square-foot facility, there are 138 pieces of production machinery equipment, such as turret presses, laser cutters, press brakes and resistance welders. This also includes a total of 2,100 assets from air and power tools to facility equipment, stationary power tools, personal-protection equipment, material handling and even janitorial supplies. However, of the 165 employees, only three are on its maintenance staff. Before CMMS was implemented, McDonald described the maintenance process as &amp;quot;a verbal and casual method of maintenance, responding to the loudest shout.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We had no time to put a preventive maintenance program in place,&amp;quot; he noted. &amp;quot;That also meant noncritical repairs sometimes got fixed before critical requests that were truly important to the operation. So downtime was a problem, too.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While implementing the two programs seemed like a big task, the initial prep work was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The ISO preparation can seem, at times, as if it&amp;#39;s adding complexity, but the end result is a streamlined system with increased efficiency across the board,&amp;quot; McDonald added.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;We get a similar result from our Bigfoot CMMS system. We had to asset-number every piece of equipment we use, down to tape measurers and air-conditioning units. Anything that needs maintenance, replacement, inspection, cleaning and calibration now has maintenance scheduled on Bigfoot CMMS.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MMP also uses CMMS for work orders, repair requests and PM scheduling. Its team generates about 2,400 work orders for PMs a year. This has allowed the company to reduce unforeseen repairs to about 20 percent of its previous workload.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	PM Efficiencies Boost Uptime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With 15 seats to serve each department and a hierarchy of requestors, MMP has eliminated interruptions from ad-hoc requests. Now, the maintenance staff is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once the PM calendar was set up, we were able to increase maintenance department productivity by being better able to distribute PMs more evenly,&amp;quot; McDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The CMMS prioritizes high-value machine PMs so MMP can stay ahead of breakdowns. This is where the biggest improvement has been seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;With our PM program, we now average 99.6 percent uptime on our production equipment,&amp;quot; McDonald noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/ycfbEGPZty4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Be More Productive with CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) is an all-in-one tool for your business management needs. Upgrading to CMMS can help your business be more effective and productive. It can manage the basics of handling equipment, vehicles and employees while also keeping track of the intricacies of payroll, accounting and human resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, the greatest benefit of CMMS is having access in the cloud when using a Web-based program, as all your business information is available to you anywhere there&amp;#39;s an Internet connection. With a login and password, you can access your account and manage your team from anywhere. Even if your building loses power or your server goes down, mobile and online apps let you keep working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Primary Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to be useful, maintenance software has to be easy to use as well as customizable, and offer options for employee management. CMMS is at its best when everyone can utilize it to improve their overall productivity and efficiency. Consider some of the following features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		User-friendly software makes it easy for you to incorporate it into your business and keep using it so that you never have to go back to notepads and post-its.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Customizable reports, menus and tables allow the program to work with the size and scope of your business.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The employee information contained in the program helps you schedule and organize your employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Special Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of how much work there is to do, administrative tasks still need to get done. Therefore, the best feature of maintenance software is that it keeps all your business accounts and information in one place. You can cross-reference employee schedules with work orders to determine your most productive salesperson, for example. Remember, the more features you use in your CMMS program, the more it will give back to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beyond the basics, maintenance software lets you keep contracts, work orders, accounts payable, pending purchase orders and more all in one place. You can use it to merge vehicle and equipment maintenance records with your calendar so that your truck never misses an oil change and your machinery is kept in good repair. Some programs also feature human resources tables that help you keep track of all your employee data, from training information to schedules to work attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Accessible at work, at home and on the go, CMMS keeps your business information secure, organized and always available. Make sure the software you choose comes with all the basics as well as any extra features that are of particular importance to your business. Implementing management software will make your business more organized, more efficient and more productive than ever.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Follow-up is Key for Greater Efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many organizations are using their computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) as a record-keeping tool. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they want, a spreadsheet perhaps can suffice. A correctly used CMMS is a tool that goes way beyond record-keeping. By not fully utilizing the CMMS, maintenance operations are missing out on opportunities to save time and money. As the utilization of CMMS increases, overall productivity and profitability also increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure you know the full functionality of your CMMS and plan ways to improve your use of it in the future. A CMMS gives you the ability to look at a massive amount of data that can be tracked over time, enabling you to make meaningful decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Full utilization of the CMMS begins with the process flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	The Ideal Process Flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are eight components of a good maintenance work process flow: notification, approval, planning, scheduling, dispatching, executing, follow-up and performance matrix. In my experience over the last 20 years, I always see three out of these eight key components. These are notification, dispatching and executing of work. Beyond that, however, the other five may not be in place at all or only in a limited form &amp;mdash; for example, planning and scheduling. However, two categories that are consistently absent are follow-up and performance matrix, even in some of the most modern maintenance environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Follow-up/Continuous Improvement&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A large part of follow-up involves reviewing and interpreting CMMS reports and completed work orders. Someone, most likely a planner or a supervisor, should review these items on a regular basis. Whether it is daily or weekly, these reports need to be consistently monitored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here are some examples of follow-up items:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Root Cause: &lt;/strong&gt;By monitoring completed work orders, you may find that there is a repeated failure on a piece of equipment. This alerts you to the fact that there is a larger problem with the device. Maintenance workers are mostly working under stressful conditions, and they are almost always rushed. They often don&amp;rsquo;t have the time to properly diagnose the problem. Instead, they perform a quick-fix, and the problem will eventually occur again. If you are performing consistent follow-up, however, you can catch this and allow more time to fix the problem completely. This saves time in the long run as you aren&amp;rsquo;t repeatedly bandaging the same injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Data Analysis: &lt;/strong&gt;A CMMS is a great tool for analyzing the data and making meaningful decisions. Examples include reviewing work-order schedule compliance, ratios of preventive maintenance and repair work orders compared to total work orders, and taking necessary corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Readings: &lt;/strong&gt;Maintenance operations frequently gather readings on a variety of equipment such as boilers, chillers, etc. In a paper-based system, forms are filled out and filed away (never to be found again). Some companies have started using their CMMS to record and save these readings (i.e., pressure, temperature, etc.). The purpose of this data is to identify abnormal readings and correct problems to prevent failures. A CMMS is just the tool to accomplish that. Once you have defined a certain range and criteria, the CMMS will flag a warning immediately upon meeting those criteria. For example, if the temperature reading falls outside of a certain range, it will notify you instantly so you can take corrective action. Otherwise, it can turn into a catastrophic failure in the future. Maintenance planning can automatically incorporate usage and condition-based preventive maintenance, predictive failure maintenance and corrective maintenance resulting from abnormal readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Make the Most of Your Time: &lt;/strong&gt;CMMS can be an excellent tool to identify non-value-added activities and shorten process cycle time as part of a follow-up/continuous improvement program. Maintenance spends a great deal of time waiting for parts, approval, instructions and equipment to be available. A CMMS can help identify where exactly maintenance is losing most of the time, enabling you to analyze the situation and correct it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Follow-up and continuous improvement hinge on the same often under-utilized quality of a CMMS &amp;mdash; data reporting. It is all well and good to track and store data, but it is useless if that data is never examined. By monitoring reports and completed work orders through a follow-up and continuous improvement process, you constantly make your operation more efficient. Higher efficiency means lower operating costs, larger savings and increased profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Streamline Your Maintenance Operation for Optimum Performance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If your backlog is piling up or you feel like you don&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources in terms of labor and parts, it may be time to work toward lean maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance is the application of lean philosophies, methods, tools and techniques to maintenance functions. It has the fundamental goals of eliminating waste associated with labor, inventory, procedures and techniques, resulting in improved productivity and reduced costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lean maintenance does not imply a slash and dash approach to cutting costs and jobs. This common method will not reduce waste or lower costs. Instead, lean maintenance philosophy decreases costs by getting rid of waste that can be defined as &amp;ldquo;anything that doesn&amp;rsquo;t add value to the maintenance process or service.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are a few areas where wastefulness and sluggishness can crop up in the maintenance department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Overproduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Overproduction in the maintenance environment means doing any work that does not add value. Examples include performing preventive and predictive maintenance tasks more often than is necessary and redoing jobs that were not done correctly the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Waiting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Areas of waste in this category include maintenance personnel waiting for equipment availability, job assignments, tools, parts, instructions, other crafts, permit approval, etc. Waiting is not a value-added activity and should be eliminated or reduced as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Transportation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Unnecessary travel is the result of ineffective planning and scheduling. This could involve a trip to the maintenance shop to get technical information or to the storeroom for parts and tools. Poorly designed preventive maintenance (PM) routes are also a major contributor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Process Waste&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When performing a breakdown repair, maintenance personnel are typically under a lot of pressure to fix the equipment as quickly as possible and often are not given enough time to fix the equipment properly. This results in a poor repair and a recurring problem. Properly performed repairs can eliminate this process waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most organizations now use some sort of computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM). Process waste also occurs when inefficiencies exist in these systems. For example, a poorly designed system may call for multiple entries of the same data, or a material requisitioning process could require redundant approvals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Defects&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In maintenance, a defect can be defined as leaving an asset in an unreliable condition. There are many causes of defects in the maintenance environment. Defects due to poor workmanship arise from insufficient training, inadequate/outdated procedures and not having the proper tools to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Spare Parts Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most storerooms contain a significant amount of obsolete inventory. This ties up capital and consumes management resources. It can easily amount to 10 to 20 percent of annual inventory dollars. Keep in mind that excess inventory is not obsolete but is inventory maintained at unnecessarily high levels. Excess inventory also ties up capital and consumes management resources. In addition, inadequate PM programs cause equipment failures, which in turn results in the need for more parts (consuming working capital) and downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A CMMS/EAM can monitor and control a spare parts inventory. It will keep track of inventory items, vendor performance, parts receipts, issues and returns. In addition, a CMMS/EAM can automate the parts purchasing process. Vendor managed and stocked inventory can also drastically reduce the parts quantity in the storeroom and save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While breakdowns and failures are never planned, they can cause the loss of productivity and money. Finding the root cause of a failure provides an organization with a solvable problem. Once the root cause is identified, a fix can be developed and implemented, preventing a recurring failure situation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Expert Tips for Planning a CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A well-planned and executed computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) project can yield a maximum return on your investment. This return is realized through increased efficiency, productivity and profits. However, a poorly planned and executed CMMS project can result in a loss of revenue. These losses can be measured in terms of the overall investment in the project, as well as from wasted time and lost projected revenue forecast tied to the successful installation and implementation of a CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Planning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Properly planning the CMMS implementation project is one of the key elements. In the planning phase, you determine the &amp;ldquo;what,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;why,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;how.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Developing a plan for equipment data is a good first step because it will provide a CMMS with a foundation of hard, verifiable data. Some maintenance departments may already employ an equipment numbering scheme that is effective. This can easily be translated into the CMMS. If there is no scheme currently in place or if the current one is flawed, it is time to develop an equipment numbering scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Determining an equipment hierarchy is the next step. This involves setting up parent/child relationships among equipment. For example, an air handler can have pumps and motors as children. If you are going to keep track of both the parent and children, the relationship must be documented. Make sure to include every piece of equipment that falls under that hierarchy scheme. Parent/child relationships also can be constructed for whole facilities. For instance, a building could be the parent with each floor a child. Each room could then be a child of the floor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Information on spare parts should be tagged to the individual pieces of equipment. This is referred to as the bill of material (BOM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finally, you need to decide what you want from your CMMS in terms of downtime monitoring. You should choose which pieces of equipment you want to monitor as well as how you want to track planned vs. unplanned downtime. Plan based on impact or loss of operation. You should have this information for each piece of equipment or at least for critical equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Preventive Maintenance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following decisions have to be made for each preventive maintenance (PM) task:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM be performed by calendar time or run time (miles, hours, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Will the PM follow a fixed schedule (regardless of completion date) or a schedule based on completion date?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often will PM work orders be generated (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What are the strategies for route-based PMs? (For example, an inspection route for all fire extinguishers in a building.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Procedures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Procedures can be preventive maintenance, safety instructions or any other set of instructions. Each piece of equipment should have identified for it all the preventive, corrective and predictive maintenance tasks necessary to properly maintain that equipment. Along with the maintenance task, information regarding maintenance frequency, responsible craft, repair and/or consumable parts necessary to compete the maintenance task, and time estimated to compete the task are some of the additional information that will enhance the usefulness of your CMMS database. These procedures can then be applied anywhere within the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Labor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need information on each maintenance technician such as name, address, phone, Social Security number, etc. You also have to decide if you are going to use some sort of ID card for your technicians that can be scanned by a reader. If you do, will the cards be produced in-house or by an outside vendor?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Inventory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The following actions must be taken:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, you have to develop a part-numbering scheme. This is similar to the process used for equipment numbering. Some companies use a 20- to 30-character-long part-numbering scheme. It includes every detail of that part (i.e., type of part, thickness, diameter, location, etc.). With advances in CMMS and a field available for each of these details (category, dimensions, location, etc.), you don&amp;rsquo;t need a part-numbering scheme to include all of the details. It just increases the potential for data-entry errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implicit in the development of a part-numbering scheme is the need to concretely define the details of parts. The most useful in terms of work flow is defining the location of a part. Is there one or multiple stockrooms? Is there a location scheme within the stockroom (i.e., aisle, bins, shelves, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the data-gathering phase, you will compile a list of all the vendors from which you buy parts and services. One of them should be assigned as a primary vendor for each part. The CMMS automatically generates purchase orders to the primary vendors. This can be changed by the users if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this stage, you have to decide the criteria for selecting a primary vendor (i.e., price, delivery, overall service, etc.). Additionally, you should track vendor/manufacturer part numbers for cross-referencing purposes. You also need to decide the issue units that you are going to use (metric, British or a combination of both). How are you going to handle inventory of pipes, beams, etc.? Are you going to keep track of lengths? If a piece is cut, are you going to keep track of the remaining pipe length? Once vendor and tracking information is decided upon, you also need to determine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who has the authority to order parts and up to what amount?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Beyond what amount will further approval be required?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the overall planning of the physical inventory process, you must make the following decisions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		How often are you going to take the physical inventory?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Who is going to do it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Is it going to be manual or using mobile technology? If it is manual, make sure your CMMS has the capability to print the appropriate forms for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Associated with this step is development of a parts label design and barcode label design. What information do you want to print on the parts labels? Part number, description and location are typical. If you are using barcoding with inventory, you have to decide which information items you want barcoded. Part number and location are typical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have multiple plants/facilities, it is important that every facility follows the same schemes. Without consistency, the CMMS will not be very effective. If you are looking for a part at a different facility and that facility describes the part differently than you do, you may not find it even if it is in stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Purchasing and Accounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You likely will need the purchasing and accounting departments involved in the planning phase for these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Bill to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;ldquo;Ship to&amp;rdquo; information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sales tax rate&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Determine budget accounts and amounts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Codes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You should determine what plan and design codes will be used throughout the CMMS. During the planning phase, you need to decide on strategies for the basis of codes. Actual compilation of codes will be done during the data-gathering phase. Determine the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Account codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order type&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Failure codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Action codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Repair codes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order priority&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment criticality&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Work order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purchase order status&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Departments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Mobile Applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are employing mobile applications, you need to identify each application and work on articulating the details. Some examples include using a hand-held remote data-entry device to collect equipment meter readings, parts can be issued and/or returned using a hand-held device, hand-held devices can be used to count and track inventory parts, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Backup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Decisions also need to be made regarding data backup. An articulated backup scheme should be formed that takes into account both hardware and setup. Determine how often backup will be done (daily, weekly, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	History&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan for the type of maintenance history you want to maintain. Your decisions should include date performed, task performed, the person(s) who performed the job, estimated and actual time to perform, equipment performed on, material used, and any outside contractor cost incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several decisions need to be made regarding the general operation of your CMMS. These questions provide information not only for planning but also for evaluating current capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Are you going to print estimated time on work orders?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What details of reports are needed in your CMMS?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Which reports are needed in graphics format?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		What decisions will be made based on reports analysis?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Security issues: Who is permitted to do what?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Field legends: Do you need to change the terms provided by your CMMS on any of the legends? If yes, be sure to document the changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Develop a list of KPIs for your application. At this stage, you should review them and revise, if necessary. Also, determine how you would compute those KPIs. Most of the KPIs should come from CMMS reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assign Responsibilities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plan on who will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Install the hardware (if necessary)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maintain the computer hardware, backups, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Perform archiving and merging of data&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Take care of disaster recovery&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Generate reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Review and analyze various reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plan and schedule work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Do the ongoing data entry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Close work orders&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be responsible for customizing, configuring, tailoring and maintaining the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planning stage of a CMMS is perhaps one of the most important in ensuring success. Granted, implementation itself is not a short process, but with a well-laid-out plan where all possibilities are considered, the process will be simpler and streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The major challenge in planning a CMMS is considering the entire breadth of your operation down to every last piece of equipment, part and facility, and then remaining realistic with your goals. Consider the abilities of your operation to adapt to a new technology in a manner that will not unduly disrupt workflow. With a laid-out plan, you will reap the rewards for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/jZOu2G5HsJE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ensure Planning and Scheduling Success</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	How do you initially train someone new to the planner/scheduler position? First, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the selection process, as I see this as an issue in many organizations. Ideally, the planner/scheduler should be one of your best craftspeople. You have to compensate the position at a level at least equal to your first-level supervision. The compensation should include accounting for the average overtime earned as a craftsperson if you expect them to apply for the position. You will not get many applicants if you are asking them to accept a significant reduction in their pay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to being a highly skilled craftsperson, the candidate should have good computer skills, a positive attitude, people-oriented and be self-motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After you have identified the right person, the obvious next step is to get that person trained. You generally have a couple of choices here. You can send them off to a class, or you can host an on-site course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This brings us to another question. How do you help guarantee success with planning and scheduling? Realize that you can send a planner/scheduler off to training, have them return and, despite their best efforts, the organization will not allow them to plan and schedule work. Providing the on-site course will allow you to educate supervisors, team leaders, managers, engineering personnel, production supervisors, production planners and anyone else who interacts with the maintenance work management process. Now everyone can understand not only the roles and responsibilities of the planner/scheduler, but also their own roles and responsibilities in relationship to the work management process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I teach maintenance planning and scheduling classes, I want to share a number of approaches. There are a several methods and opinions on how to plan and schedule work. What I find is that some groups actually do a disservice to their course participants by not sharing a comprehensive approach with various methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After the initial training is complete, recognize that you are only one-third to halfway done. After about one to two months, it&amp;rsquo;s time to bring in a coach. Ideally, the coach is an external resource who walks a mile beside the new planner/scheduler. The purpose of this is to observe the activities of the planner/scheduler and also the interactions within the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When I coach and mentor, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to determine if the planner/scheduler is applying the items learned in the class. Are they creating job plans? Is the continuous improvement loop in place? Is the planner/scheduler focused on the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to see how the supervisors are interacting. Do they understand their roles and the planner&amp;rsquo;s roles? Are work orders being completed and data entered into the CMMS? Is the organization aligned for proactive scheduling? These are just a few of the items that I address in my coaching sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The number of coaching sessions depends on the organization. It may only be one to two in total. Now, about retraining, a number of organizations bring me back on a semi-annual to annual basis to provide an overall best practices health check as a good method to determine if the organization is continuing to mature in its implementation efforts. If it has gone stagnant, I&amp;rsquo;ll point out the obstacles and help get them back on the road to success. Ultimately, this is my primary goal. I have a passion for maintenance and operations, so I really care about people being successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If not an external resource, someone internally needs to remove the obstacles to ensure effective planning and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With respect to retraining, you should always be in a state of constant learning. That means reading articles and attending events that foster learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a two-day maintenance management course in California&amp;rsquo;s wine country, I met a planner/scheduler who attended the course the previous year. At the end of the course, I asked him why he chose to re-attend so soon afterward. He mentioned that he had forgotten a number of items, and the main one was creating job plans. Wow! Besides scheduling the work, this is one of the most important parts of planning and scheduling. This example highlights the need for retraining, especially if you opted not to provide coaching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/uwGGjHxfRmU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Maintain an Equipment Registry </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The equipment registry is one of the most important tools in your kit when it comes to maintenance and reliability. It can be the foundation of your planned maintenance, lubrication, training and repair programs, as well as help with regulatory compliance and safety programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your spare parts management program depends upon a complete and accurate registry with the requisite analysis for regular service parts along with the insurance spares identified through failure modes and effects analysis. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that your financials are also tied in through depreciation, amortization and cost center assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment history gets tied to the registry along with manuals, drawings, procedures, labor costs and reports. That is why it is the foundation upon which so much is built, and that is why it is so vital that you get it right and work to maintain its accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While it has an initial cost and a maintenance cost, the payback can be significant and continuous, so make the investment even if you have to bump something else down the list. The man-hours that you save long term will repay your investment many times over. You can consider the downtime and spares savings as icing on the cake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What the Registry Should Look Like&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you have an enterprise asset management (EAM) or computerized maintenance management system (CMMS), you are already set up with specific fields in a database. Review those fields to be sure that they satisfy your needs and then examine the registry for completeness and accuracy. You may be able to rename some fields to suit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an EAM or CMMS with built-in equipment registry, or you are evaluating a program for your plant, then be sure that it provides a minimum number of data fields for the basic information you need. This is one of those cases where more is better. Of course, smaller plants can manage with cheaper versions of programs or even with simple spreadsheets if they are configured correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a bare minimum, you will need fields such as equipment name, manufacturer name, model number, serial number, location installed in the plant, description and date installed. You can add fields for service vendor, warranty period, capacity, functional location, superior equipment number, bill of materials (BOM) file number (if not included as a separate function in your software), and the original purchase order number if desired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Equipment Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is what you call it for your records. Make this understandable to everyone, and don&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of abbreviations or acronyms if they are common to your process. You can form the standard here for your plant, so think about it up front. You will put this on labels, reports, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) screens, procedures, and work order titles, so it needs to have a structure that makes sense. A standardized structure will be necessary because you will also sort data like work orders by this name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Manufacturer Name&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and not the guy who sold it to you or installed it. List that outfit under the vendor name or in the comment section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Model Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This number connects you to OEM manuals and services, and works with the serial number to tell your vendor exactly which machine you are talking about when you call for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Serial Number&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The serial number with the model number is very important information. With just the model and serial number, the OEM can usually pull up any information you need on parts and procedures. Verify that what you have recorded matches the actual nameplate on the unit. Some manufacturers maintain separate part numbers and drawing numbers for each serial number unit. Plus, there may be some subtle differences in your unit because of a special requirement that is only recorded in the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specific serial number record. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to order a $10,000 part, wait eight weeks for it to arrive and then find it doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Date Installed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You use this date for warranty coverage, for depreciation financials and for setting up initial service and preventive maintenance schedules. It can also help managers decide if it is time to upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is your in-house location code. Some large companies include country and plant codes on the front, but the basics are building, floor and quadrant. You can also use column numbers in the place of or in addition to the quadrant code to narrow it down even further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the time when you establish your standard nomenclature for your equipment. It needs to be descriptive, standard and universally understood. Limit this to 40 to 60 characters for ease of sorting later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Comment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The comment field is a free-form text block that you use to capture what the equipment does for your plant and any special information that you want available for use, such as the vendor name, unit capacity or anything else you feel is important. If you don&amp;rsquo;t do it anywhere else, take this opportunity to record the design capacity and the machine&amp;rsquo;s relationship to other equipment (e.g., supply fan 04 for HVAC unit 03-03-12 with capacity of 1,500 cfm @ 5&amp;Prime;w.c.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of your equipment registry cannot be emphasized enough. Your technical training, spare parts, financials and work order systems all depend on accurate equipment records. Good records can shorten the troubleshooting times, facilitate training of new personnel, capture modification events, contribute to better management decisions by providing timely and dependable financial data, and increase reliability over the lifespan of the equipment. Couple these records with a labeling program and you can expect to enjoy good experiences with your installed equipment base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/qFExzFbYM4U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Lack of Training Threatens CMMS Project</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Training for users of a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a multiple-phase process. There are three areas of training needs: basic training, application (CMMS) training and internal training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Basic Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make sure people who will operate the CMMS are familiar with computer basics and the operating system. If not, provide them with basic training so they are ready for CMMS application training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Application (CMMS) Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This can be done in two different phases &amp;mdash; initial training to get the system up and running, and advanced training after spending a period of time with the CMMS. Long training (five to 10 days) is not recommended, since most people forget the majority of the items learned. Timing of the training should be kept in mind. Don&amp;rsquo;t train too early in the day. Training should be coordinated with implementation. Trainees should leave the class and use what they have learned immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Internal Training&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also need to train CMMS users with internal processes. This is often ignored in most CMMS implementation projects. Your software vendor will only train you on how the CMMS application works. You have to do the internal training yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, take equipment numbering schemes. CMMS users should be trained on numbering schemes to avoid erroneous data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another good example is inventory part description. If part description data entry is not consistent, you will find a corrupt inventory database after a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work order data entry is another example. Descriptions such as &amp;ldquo;machine down&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;doesn&amp;rsquo;t work,&amp;rdquo; followed by a repair description of &amp;ldquo;done&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fixed,&amp;rdquo; will not give you meaningful history. Therefore, proper and consistent job description training is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	General Training Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be sure that every trainee is given enough help to become comfortable and confident in what he or she is doing. Even a small shortage of needed training can cause an employee to backslide, lose confidence and eventually cause project failure. The new system cannot afford that. All personnel who will use the CMMS, maintain it or oversee its operation should be included in the training process.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accept any and all training support from your vendor. You may wish to contract with your vendor for additional training support or follow-up training programs or services. Remember, while the training initially may seem like an expensive proposition, in the long run it will not only prove beneficial but also very cost effective.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Training should be an ongoing process. New users should receive the full course, while current users should take refreshers as needed or desired. This continuity will accommodate the inevitable personnel changes and system evolutions that will occur over the life of the system. As users leave, their replacements must be trained as thoroughly as if they had been original users. This need is frequently overlooked.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		During the training process, the newly installed CMMS can be checked thoroughly to assure that it works as planned. Feedback from trainees should be recorded and analyzed to assist in evaluating system performance and potential modification. Action on trainee responses not only will result in system refinements but also will improve the general acceptance of the CMMS.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Saving Time and Money with Condition Monitoring </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A recent acoustic emission (AE) study identified a potential critical bearing failure that became a planned preventive action for a leading food manufacturer. This also avoided considerable cost and unplanned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The acoustic emission equipment and the main tool used during the planned inspection routes were manufactured by Holroyd Instruments. This example will show the value of this type of equipment in avoiding a major unplanned event that could have had massive cost consequences for the business. Collateral damage to the associated equipment would have proved very costly, and the lead time to rebuild could have caused extensive downtime that would have meant disgruntled customers not being able to rely on stock availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The story began in April 2010 when some initial elevated readings were noted at two node points on a large step-down transfer gearbox that were sampled on a seven-day routine. The distress readings were elevated and triggered the alarm level. They were of concern and evident on subsequent inspections. The third elevated reading that was part of an upward trend instigated a planned work order in the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) to investigate and take further action. This equipment could not be taken out of service lightly, as it was at the time constrained by high production demands. Experience with a sister line&amp;rsquo;s previous planned bearing change also played an important part in the escalation of the risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/9947803a-3bb4-493b-9873-9b1e92eff658_gearbox.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 558px; height: 352px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The input side of a transfer gearbox is shown with the output bearing node point on the left-hand side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On more detailed inspections, it was determined that the bearing with the highest distress was indeed the suspected output bearing. Audible clicks were loud and clear at the output end bearing. The two bearings at the node locations were on the drive line of the motor at the input and output ends of the transfer gearbox. The adjacent bearings on the large, helical step-down gear were still reading low and had no audible clicks. The engineering manager was advised that there was an anomaly on one of the input bearings, that the others were in good condition and that production could continue with targeted condition monitoring. The routine oil sampling was increased from monthly to every two weeks. AE inspections were increased, with spectrum readings now on a four-day cycle. This would give some comparative evidence when the new bearings were eventually fitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The planned change of the bearing set was arranged with the production planner, maintenance manager and product specialist. It became clear that the equipment would have to operate for at least another six months until it became available. Contingency plans were formulated for an emergency change if any of the AE readings or oil samples showed advances toward failure. Warnings were issued that this could occur rapidly if the bearing failed. A new bearing set was purchased, and a meeting was scheduled with the bearing manufacturer to examine the used bearings when they were eventually changed in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The AE readings stayed at an elevated level during this long waiting phase, and oil sample results showed no elevated readings in the key elements associated with roller bearing failures. During the weeks before renewal, many spectra were taken from all points of the gearbox for future evaluation. This would rule out frequencies from the oil pump and other components around the assembly. An AE envelope spectrum graph before the bearing change is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/254014f7-f16e-44dd-96f8-d80ead41bf1d_spectra 2.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 630px; height: 209px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As can be seen, there was something creating a spike at 73Hz, which happened to match the frequency of the bearing race. This provided a clue that there was a race surface defect of some kind and not an element breaking down or the cage disintegrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bearing change finally took place, and the production plant was turned around within 12 hours so that the equipment did not incur any unplanned downtime. The used bearing set was returned with the transfer gearbox, and the two units were degreased. On first inspection, they both looked similar and in good order. The elements and cages were then dismantled from the outer and inner races, with care taken to keep them in order and in the correct aspect for reassembly later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It became clear that on the suspect output bearing, a major spall on the inner race had developed, and every element was pitted with the debris that had emitted. At this point, a representative from the bearing manufacturer was invited to visit and examine the bearings. He concurred that the bearings had lasted very well considering the atmosphere and heat in which they had operated for almost 10 years. This would be considered an end-of-lifetime mode of failure. It may have lasted many more months or could have accelerated to failure within days or weeks. The photograph below is of the spall that measured approximately 10 mm in length and 2.5 mm wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/5/18/3a11d97c-28b7-4388-aa85-57dc40e9a028_spall damage.jpeg" style="width: 630px; height: 473px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Spall damage to the race is shown above with feathered edges and surface pitting in the loaded area of the spalling. Note the next layer of material on the right-hand side that would have given way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the remedial work had been completed, additional spectrum samples were recorded and monitored to learn more. Carpet noise levels were lower, and the decibel scale was a third of the previous graph example. The maximum peak was now less than 0.4 decibels, while the carpet level was less than 0.2 decibels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In conclusion, the systems and tools relied on every day proved effective in capturing this anomaly before it turned into a major event. The key to this was the full involvement of engineering with operations to plan in the remedial work with as little disruption as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Among the lessons learned were that the inspection frequencies at seven-day intervals were correct for this critical plant, the preventive action was started at the earliest opportunity, the equipment enabled the pinpointing of the bearing fault, the audio facility allowed a second reference that linked rpm with the audible clicks and that this all gave sufficient evidence for the planned work to commence at the earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Root-cause analysis was carried out directly after the bearing change was completed to investigate any future recommendations for servicing this equipment. It was decided that as the bearings had reached their end-of-life cycle, there was no need to alter any future planned maintenance. Condition monitoring with AE had provided the confidence to pick up any anomalies at a very early stage in the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A Better Way to Buy Maintenance Parts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	During a recent maintenance-management seminar, the topic of purchasing cards (P-cards) being taken away for misuse almost created a riot among the group. One of the more frequent complaints from maintenance people is that they just want the parts to do their job right. While P-cards help enable this, they can be a curse at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Typically, many organizations do not have a good partnership between the maintenance, materials management and purchasing functions. The illusion of a partnership exists, but not a real partnership. As such, maintenance uses the P-cards as a method to navigate around the difficulties of purchasing parts and materials through the normal channels. Face it: We enjoy the freedom of just running or calling down to the local supply house to get what we need. Needless to say, there are lots of issues embedded here, but let&amp;rsquo;s just focus on one part of the P-card curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If we are using the P-card to navigate outside the normal purchasing and materials management channels, that generally means we are purchasing parts and materials outside the CMMS/EAM systems. While some groups have great procedures for getting P-card purchases into the CMMS, most don&amp;rsquo;t. For many organizations, here is how the process works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1) The maintenance supervisor shags the parts on the P-card. Maybe they get a receipt at the time of purchase or maybe not.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		2) Some 30 to 60 days later, they reconcile the receipts with the credit-card bill when it comes from accounting and charge it to a budget cost center in a blanket order fashion. I already hear some of you asking, &amp;ldquo;So what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with this approach?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s the problem with the scenario above. The individual parts and materials along with their cost didn&amp;rsquo;t get charged to each individual work order. Talk about a lagging metric! It may be 90 days before we see the actual money spent hit the budget, so we are flying blind. Even then, we still don&amp;rsquo;t know the money spent or actual parts used at the individual equipment level. We might know an area at best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Worse, we lost the opportunity to build our bill of materials (BOM) in the CMMS. Every time we buy an item, even if we don&amp;rsquo;t stock it, we should be assigning the item a non-stock part number, capturing the description, cost and sourcing information to link it to our equipment. It may be the only way we have to build the bill of materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We need to get in the habit of buying everything through the CMMS, even if using P-cards to purchase. Doing this gives us the ability to build the bill of materials for our equipment. We understand the usage so we can make intelligent stocking decisions with materials management. We know our costs down to the individual equipment levels. We aren&amp;rsquo;t waiting 90 days to understand the cost of each work order. Furthermore, we can use our equipment data in the CMMS to determine where we are spending our money and see if we are having issues with types of parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that if you are using P-cards, make sure you have procedures that are audited and enforced to overcome the P-card curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/R1XSHJAI-FE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to Enable Process Redesign and CMMS Success </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	If you desire to implement a world-class effective reliability/maintenance process in your plant, two sequential projects must be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First, map/document the how, what, where and when of what is happening today &amp;mdash; not as the manuals say it is to be performed, but what is actually happening. This should be done with a facilitated team with full disclosure and comments allowed from all concerned. Avoid calling it re-engineering; it is an effort to gain full understanding of &amp;ldquo;today.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The team should be representative of the maintenance organization (include crafts and operations). This will take several months and should not be secretive. The working lives of many people are going to be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much of the mapping tools come from total quality management (TQM). Some process flow charts and fishbones can cover the walls. What is being documented is the work order from inception to sign-off by the customer and archiving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this process-management documentation will come understanding and buy-in that we really understand what we are now doing. Byproducts of the effort are suggestions on what the process should be and why. After the present is known, it will be possible to write objectives for the process we want to implement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Second, the team should design what they consider to be a world-class maintenance organization and how it would operate. Again, a skilled facilitator should lead this. New to the same batch of tools are brainstorming and negotiation. Remember, here is where work is being redesigned with impacts on all involved. It may be advisable to have a human resources person on the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From this comes a process-management chart defining the new process and, by the way, the information required to make it happen. Now we are beginning to define the requirements for our computerized maintenance management system (CMMS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An interesting tool at this point is to get everyone involved in mentally walking through his or her workday as if the new process was in place. From this comes understanding and identification of training, roadblocks and a new language replete with openness of feelings and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now a plan of implementation can take place. Communicate, communicate, communicate. Remember, the most important employee in a process is the one who operates a machine or process. His or her skill makes it or breaks it. Who is the most important person when the machine fails? The maintenance technician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that a new process must provide actionable information tied to assisting the technician to perform world-class work and feel a bit of self-actualization at the end of the day. How does the redesigned process help him on a daily basis? If it does not, it&amp;rsquo;s back to the process design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a new CMMS is included in the planning, now is the time to complete the specifications and start the acquisition process. I doubt there is a CMMS that meets all the requirements, and there may have to be some modifications to your expectations. Just be sure to buy the CMMS that supports your process, not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/fE4GQ7cklOw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Information Management is Key to Maintenance Performance </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Information management is one area that is often overlooked. It&amp;rsquo;s actually one of the more important areas, but it lacks glamor and excitement. It requires steady, regular and planned effort, so we naturally gravitate toward the areas that give us the periodic rush of adrenaline that most fix-it types crave. Unfortunately, if you ignore the benefits of information management, you get more opportunities to work long hours under stress to fight the fires and &amp;ldquo;be the hero.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	My personal idea of a hero is someone who quietly and consistently does the unglamorous drudge work behind the scenes that prevents those breakdowns and lays the groundwork to reduce their effects when one does occur. This unsung hero grinds through the manuals, reads the spec sheets, peruses the trade magazines and spends hours asking the vendors questions about their products and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our information hero then spends more hours compiling the information gleaned into usable formats and posts it where the supervisors and technicians can quickly find it when it is needed. The job of being the information hero is rarely recognized or rewarded, but it still needs to be done if you want to get the maximum from your technicians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We all talk about wrench time and maximizing productivity, but achieving it is not an easy, overnight event. You go out of your way to find good people. You buy them good tools. You supply them with a safe work environment. You even try to get them some technical training. So why do you deny them good information that will make their jobs easier and improve their performance? No one does it on purpose, but again it is the drudge work that we all unconsciously avoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solution is to get organized and get started. You may not be the right person for information hero, but look around your shop and see if there is a Superman hiding behind his Clark Kent persona&amp;mdash; someone who can and will grind through the necessary tasks for you. Once you establish guidelines, much of the work can be done by office staff, so don&amp;rsquo;t overlook those resources for the job. Administrative assistants are accustomed to managing vast amounts of information, so your maintenance and reliability data is just another format to them that they add to the mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your guidelines and framework should be simple, and the files themselves should be easily accessible by those who need the information. Something as simple as file cabinets married with a file tree on your plant network can work. I like to keep hard copies of manuals, drawings and some procedures that you can carry to the worksite or to the shop, so those go into a file cabinet. Each item should be labeled with the cabinet number and file name so they get back home. Add that to a file tree with folders and equipment files that are all in standard format, and you have a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Build your file tree based on functional locations, systems, process flow, alphabetical order or whatever makes sense to you and your people. (Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to have a place for the generic stuff.) Use the names that are common to everyone or that you want to become common, and then label the equipment that way to reinforce it. Create some standard templates for master data forms, and you are in business to collect, collate and store information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Have a master data document for each piece of equipment that acts as a gateway to everything you ever want to know about that piece of equipment. You put in all of the standard, basic information like manufacturer name, model, serial number and capacity at the top, and then add a short description of where it is and what it does. Insert links to other documents, and it acts as the doorway to all relevant information. You can even use it as an equipment history document for modifications, updates and special knowledge items that don&amp;rsquo;t fit anywhere else. The uses are only limited by your imagination. Keep in mind that human nature says that if it isn&amp;rsquo;t simple and easy to use, it probably won&amp;rsquo;t be used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once your troops see a value in it, they will use it as the first-choice place to look, so back it up regularly and review it at least annually to make sure the data is still relevant. There needs to be a mechanism for adding new info and comments so you get the experience of your techs available for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about grammar or spelling, since you can always edit that later. If your CMMS or EAM system has the capacity for this function, great! If not, or if you are a small operation without those programs, this is a way to hang onto the data that can help. Even a link to a relevant original equipment manufacturer or service provider&amp;rsquo;s Web page may be the key to saving hours of downtime. Having the data and the links easily accessible saves the trips to the job site armed with flashlights where you try to read a nameplate that has probably been painted at least twice. When you stack the deck in your favor, this is one of the cards that you want in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/Xe8lgJjMXP4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>10 Keys to Successful CMMS Implementation</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The statistics are startling &amp;mdash; up to 80 percent of all computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) implementations have failed. When considering the costs associated with a CMMS project, an 80-percent failure rate is a tough number for any company to overcome, but with simple steps for a well thought-out implementation plan, anyone can harness the full potential that CMMS can bring to an organization. What follows is an introduction to the steps you can take to ensure your CMMS implementation is a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Determining the Scope of Your Project&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Rushing to purchase a CMMS package often leads to a rush to implement. Stop and think before you buy. One of the top five reasons for implementation failure is wrong CMMS selection. You need the right CMMS for your application, and the scope should be defined before you select the package. What exactly are you looking for your CMMS to do? What modules are critical to your business now &amp;mdash; equipment, preventive maintenance, etc.? Can some modules such as purchasing wait awhile? How do you see your company using CMMS after two or even five years? Will you be interfacing it with other systems or using mobile technology in the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/6/200637fc-8bfb-4ed0-9264-fe80fbfbbf30_keys_300x200.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;2) Getting Management Commitment&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Often executive management doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a clear conception of CMMS and the types of initial and ongoing resources that must be committed to the project. Aside from the acquisition software cost, there are ongoing costs for maintenance, training, data gathering and data entry, to name a few. Make sure these costs are included in the project estimate to give upper management a full picture of the time and budget required for your project. This will help you to receive their commitment for the full project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Planning Your Project&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Think about your implementation from start to finish. What are the key milestones? Determine who will be implementing the CMMS, who will be gathering data and what types of data they will be gathering. Figure out a parts numbering scheme, an equipment ID scheme, location schemes, and labor and material charge accounts. Define code tables as a team during the planning phase such as work order type, work order status and completion remark codes. Some initial planning can reduce confusion later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Preparing for Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t make the assumption that all of your employees will welcome the CMMS with open arms. Employees may see the CMMS as a tool that will replace them in the future, and workers are fearful of anything that may put them out of work. It&amp;rsquo;s important to get all of your employees involved early, publish informational memos about the change, and hold question-and-answer sessions to get employee input so workers take ownership in the project and are excited about the positive change that CMMS can bring. What obstacles can your current maintenance workers visualize in terms of data gathering and data entry? Are certain workers resistant to the change? One resistant worker now can cause unnecessary obstacles later, leading to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	CMMS is a sophisticated application and will require training for all employees using the system. Don&amp;rsquo;t make the mistake of underestimating your training requirements. There will need to be initial software training from the CMMS vendor and ongoing (or internal) training for your employees. Every organization implements CMMS in a different way, and your employees need training on your specific CMMS use. Training employees on the way your company uses terminology is important. The distinction between a &amp;ldquo;bulb,&amp;rdquo; a &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;compact fluorescent&amp;rdquo; may seem like splitting hairs now, but can lead to confusion and purchasing errors down the road. As new employees are hired, they will need training, too. Timing of training is also important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Data gathering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Gathering all of the necessary and usable data your employees will need to enter into the CMMS is usually the biggest culprit in any implementation project failure. Effectively gathering all of the data will usually require six to 12 months of committed manpower resources. Determining what data will be gathered (equipment model, serial numbers, cost, warranty data, preventive maintenance, procedures and frequencies, parts and parts information) and how that data will be gathered is a key component of your implementation plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) Data Entry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve planned out your implementation, purchased your system and gathered your data. Having a solid plan for how to enter the data into the system will deter confusion later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, there is a massive amount of work required for entering in all of the data you have gathered. Who will do this job? There are outside contractors to consider, current employees to tap or temporary hires. Fortunately, this large amount of work only needs to be done once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, you need to determine the best method of entering in the necessary day-to-day information that the CMMS will manage. Should an administrative assistant enter in completed work orders at the end of the day or will each maintenance technician enter in his or her own completed work orders? Consider each possible solution to determine the pros and cons of your specific situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;8) Reports and Analysis&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;Having four or five effective and usable reports is far more productive for your system than having hundreds of reports that no one will access. Think about who will be analyzing these reports on a day-to-day basis. What decisions will be made based on the analyses? Before you even set up your system, figure out what you need the system to do for you. Tailor your reports accordingly. Also, ensure that your reports are giving you the information you need to understand short- and long-term trends in maintenance operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;9) Follow-up and Continuous improvement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t just use the CMMS as a record-keeping tool to keep lists of your assets and their parts. Spreadsheets can do that. Make sure your employees know the full functionality of a CMMS and plan ways to improve your use of it in the future. A CMMS gives you the ability to look at a massive amount of trackable data. Is someone looking at the data? How can you spot trends, analyze them and take corrective action? For example, are there failures with a specific piece of equipment or a part? The CMMS can help you determine why those failures are happening. Are you constantly monitoring and improving upon your maintenance operation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;10) Links and Attachments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Take advantage of all that a CMMS has to offer. Some systems allow you to add various types of documents (Word, PDF, scanned copy, digital pictures, audios, videos or Web links) to records. Is Bob the only maintenance technician on the floor who can repair a specific machine? What happens when Bob retires? With CMMS attachments, after a few years, anyone can access the information saved by Bob to see how the repair can be completed. The attachment tool is also handy for attaching PDF versions of original manuals, training guides and other paper-only materials that can easily be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/kH3-yCi8b0g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How Signage and Labeling can Improve Reliability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The importance of signage and labeling is often underplayed or even ignored when a maintenance program is being discussed. Since we are visual creatures and the visual workplace is the direct application of this, we should take a few minutes to go over some reasons and applications for signage and labeling to get more attention in our programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Signage can be for several reasons, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regulatory compliance (e.g., personal protective equipment, arc flash, Department of Transportation placarding)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Access control, such as &amp;ldquo;Authorized Personnel Only&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Fire safety, such as extinguisher locations and fire exits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		General safety (e.g., cautions about fork truck traffic)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Behavior and training purposes (safety reminders and CPR how-to directions)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Labeling is usually more specific but is also varied in use. Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Piping labels per ANSI standard&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment labeling for the CMMS&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Storage location labels&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Special tools and tooling&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Safety equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment set points and wear indicators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these and more play an important part in achieving your maintenance and reliability goals. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that one of the biggest factors in your success is your ability to communicate effectively with your operators and technicians. They need clear direction on proper behavior and actions. A few generic, half-hearted exhortations to &amp;ldquo;work smarter&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;work safely&amp;rdquo; look nice on the wall, but do they truly achieve their intent if they are not coupled with specific instructions? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It takes visible, useful and targeted information to let your people know what you expect from them. In exchange, you have to provide them the tools they need to make it happen. Proper signage and labeling moves your organization in the right direction and does so at a very reasonable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a look around your maintenance shop first and look for the simple things like the safety posters, the grinder guard safety labels, the special tools storage labels, the fire equipment, oily rag storage, etc., that you could do right away. Then, expand out into areas that are under your control and start putting up the signs and labels that you can see are missing. Go to the various safety sites on the Internet and check your general vendors for what they offer for ideas. I guarantee that you will see opportunities for everything from flammable materials storage to pinch points, arc flash and many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your piping labels are especially important if your process includes hazardous materials or high pressures and temperatures. Don&amp;rsquo;t forget the directional arrows for clarity where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Equipment labels pay off big time for your CMMS system and for improving the accuracy of your work orders, as well as assisting your safety program. Putting the identification number or code, a proper description and the power shut-off locations on the tag are the bare minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ID number gets the work orders written to the right spot and ties together bills of material, standard operating procedures and lockout/tagout procedures as well as just about anything else your imagination can connect to that unique piece of equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The proper description gets everyone using the same name for it, and that reduces confusion. Everyone has run into the problem of the new guy who calls it a widget when you call it a whatsit. Save time all around and get everyone on the same page with a simple tag or label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Power source locations are a big safety item that could help to save an injury or equipment damage by directing people to the shut-off right away. Don&amp;rsquo;t pass up this opportunity to save time in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Your operations partners will recognize the value quickly. Jobs are recorded more accurately, take less time and get done safer. Who could argue with that? They will want to get on the train with you and share in the good results. Plus, it is fairly cheap, can be done with in-house labor and can be spread out over months or even over multiple budget years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember, reliability doesn&amp;rsquo;t cost; it pays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/YBG1BQgEFRc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Selecting Reliability-Improvement Tools</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I started in maintenance, I loved looking at the tool catalogs and, of course, imagined how nice it would be to have one of those gigantic tool sets. You know, the tool set with something for every job. Similar to most of the other new guys, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to purchase that kind of tool set and had to settle for a much smaller one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over time, purchasing tools to increase my toolbox capability was based on need and understanding of the function of the tool. This proved to be a great way to learn how to use my toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If in the beginning I was able to purchase the dream set, I probably would not utilize half the tools because I would find myself overwhelmed and sticking to the core tools I understand and only occasionally running across something that I might find a use for. That would have not been a very good investment. By investing in tools as I understand their function, I am able to get the most out of them, and they will get used because I am more aware of them being there by the &amp;ldquo;new toy&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management and improvement tools are the same way. It is easy to dream of having a facility with all of the tools working harmoniously together and being utilized to their fullest extent. The problem is this rarely happens. Most successful programs start with the choice of one or two core tools and then add on as function and need permit. This allows people time to get to understand the tools and develop habits that are effective in application of the tools. As time goes along, those people are better equipped to be able to adapt to more tools in their toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen many horror stories in the making of companies who think that throwing money at problems automatically makes them better and eventually leads to trouble-free bliss. Throwing money or resources at problems often causes more confusion and inefficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An example of this is a situation where I watched a maintenance manager and a maintenance supervisor replacing buckets on a standard bucket elevator that would normally be a one-man (or possibly two-man) job. The problem was that they were being watched by two Class A mechanics and one Class B mechanic, who were providing the tools for the manager and supervisor to use. Inefficiency has no limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You might ask, &amp;ldquo;What is the right tool for me to start with?&amp;rdquo; I recommend determining what your biggest headache is and then finding the tool to fix it. The tools can range from standard management tools to advanced tools that are designed to deal with a specific issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One thing I recommend before undertaking a bunch of the other tools is a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This will provide a solid foundation for some of the other tools to be added later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another recommendation is to implement a reliability program prior to investing in predictive maintenance tools, because it may help you determine which predictive tools you need or want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/ZRYqYScl7a0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>5 Time Wasters for Reliability Engineers to Avoid</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	You&amp;rsquo;ve heard the catch phrases. You&amp;rsquo;ve read the success stories. You&amp;rsquo;ve seen the return on investment (ROI) calculations and the positive trending that reliability engineers bring. You&amp;rsquo;ve even lobbied upper management. Your argument has been so convincing that you&amp;rsquo;ve secured approval in this year&amp;rsquo;s budget to hire a reliability engineer. The hiring process has begun, and you can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the results: more reliable equipment, fewer failures and increased availability and production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If only it were that easy. Building a reliability program led by competent professionals takes work. It requires setting expectations properly. Most of all, it requires time. How do you accelerate the process to ensure the maximum benefit in the shortest time? Avoiding these top five time wasters could help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Vision&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	No, we aren&amp;rsquo;t talking about whether your reliability engineer could have been a fighter pilot or whether he needs bifocals, although not being able to read the computer screen while reviewing an asset hierarchy certainly will slow one down. A lack of an overall vision for your facility&amp;rsquo;s reliability program is the No. 1 reason for inefficiency and wasted effort, not just in a reliability program, but with any initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Education&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Before I became a reliability engineer, I worked as a project engineer improving equipment performance through sound engineering principles. I often was involved in maintenance engineering activities, troubleshooting equipment failures as they occurred in the hopes of getting the plant back up and running as soon as possible. My boss had read an article about the benefits of having a staff reliability engineer, and literally overnight the reliability engineer position was initiated. I was then asked to take the job.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	What changed? The title on my business card and the signature line on my e-mails. I continued to perform the same maintenance engineering activities without any real strategic direction, for we had no vision of what we wanted our reliability program to look like.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I worked within my means throughout the next year to learn more about what true reliability engineering was. I learned the difference between a condition-based maintenance strategy, a time-based maintenance strategy and a run-to-failure maintenance strategy, which we had (by neglect) been practicing at our facility for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More importantly, I learned that a smart combination of the three strategies is ideal, depending on the criticality of the system in question. I educated my boss, and he educated his boss. We learned that reliability best practices are well-established, so there&amp;rsquo;s no need to reinvent the wheel.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We also discovered that there are no shortcuts. For example, if you want accurate failure data, you need to have a computerized maintenance-management system in place. It needs to have an accurate hierarchy that represents the parent/child relationships that represent your plant or facility. The system needs to be populated by operations and maintenance with work requests, failure codes and material/labor dollars so that accurate analysis can be performed. Building an accurate hierarchy takes time and money, and there are companies that have done it before which can help make the process less painful. It&amp;rsquo;s the foundation of any reliability program, and like a foundation for a house, if done poorly will result in imminent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Master Plan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once there&amp;rsquo;s an understanding of reliability best practices, you need a plan that&amp;rsquo;s in line with the reliability program&amp;rsquo;s overall vision. Develop a clear methodology that can be understood at all levels of your organization. It should start with an assessment of current-state reliability practices &amp;mdash; where are you and your facility now in your reliability journey? &amp;mdash; as well as well-defined tasks that can bring your program in line with your vision. As with any good project plan, these tasks should have well-defined dates and persons responsible for completion. Resources such as people, money and time should be defined, and proper approval from site leadership must be obtained.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Communication is vital to ensure proper expectations are set and maintained. For example, if site leadership doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand that before maintenance plans can be developed and optimized, site hierarchy needs to be established and a criticality assessment performed, then they&amp;rsquo;ll wonder what you&amp;rsquo;re working on in all of those cross-functional development meetings, all the while not seeing the desired results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Lack of Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Prioritization of effort is a challenge we all face, regardless of industry or occupation. In this economic environment, we&amp;rsquo;re constantly asked to do more with less, and there are only so many hours in the day. Where and how we, as reliability engineers, spend our time is of utmost importance. The reliability engineer&amp;rsquo;s responsibilities are vast and overwhelming: developing cost-effective maintenance strategies for critical equipment; conducting root cause analysis investigations to eliminate or mitigate repetitive failures; implementing effective corrective actions; developing and ensuring proper use of facility management of change (MOC) policies and procedures; identifying limiting factors that lead to high energy, utility, maintenance and supply-chain costs. This list could go on and on, but the question remains the same: where do you start?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	You and your site leadership can determine where the priorities are and address the most critical items first if you have a well-defined vision, a master plan and the proper education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	No Measuring Stick&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	How do you know how well you&amp;rsquo;re performing? Are you and the reliability program getting the results you desire? Are they in line with the overall vision set forth in your reliability program? How can you tell?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Waiting for the year-end numbers is like looking at the final score of a football game to see how your team is doing: you might get the information you want but far too late to make the necessary adjustments. A robust reliability program has a strong mix of both leading indicators, which tell you how you are doing day in and day out, and lagging indicators, which tell you how you did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If I wanted to evaluate the success of a facility&amp;rsquo;s predictive maintenance (PdM) program, I&amp;rsquo;d need to understand the number of critical assets under surveillance, whether inspections are performed on time, the percentage of identified issues that get entered into the computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS), as well as the overall program costs, dollar value of saves and annualized cost per unit asset. Once understood, such metrics foster informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no sense in reinventing the wheel. Such indicators should be clear, concise and make sense for where you and your facility are on your reliability journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you know it or not, all of us are on a reliability journey. Just as there&amp;rsquo;s no job that goes unplanned &amp;mdash; even an unplanned job gets planned haphazardly during the execution process &amp;mdash; we and the organizations we support make decisions every day that affect how smoothly the trip goes. Proper alignment and planning can help you avoid the first three time wasters. Proper execution circumvents the fourth time waster, and proper control mitigates the final time waster. Comparison to industry-accepted standards shows us how far we&amp;rsquo;ve come and how much farther there is to go.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>How to Achieve Effective Maintenance Planning </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As Sisyphus well knew, pushing things up mountains is difficult, and the uphill struggle from the reactive to the proactive maintenance world is often a frustrating &amp;ldquo;three steps forward, two steps back&amp;rdquo; process. That&amp;rsquo;s a major reason why so many slide back into the familiar, ugly, day-to-day, survival morass at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of those steps on the way up is where preventive maintenance inspections are getting done, we&amp;rsquo;re finding things that need to be fixed and we&amp;rsquo;re fixing them. However, we&amp;rsquo;re still not getting that much better. We&amp;rsquo;re constantly fixing the same things over and over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The famous quote, &amp;ldquo;Those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it,&amp;rdquo; remains as true as always.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, the &amp;ldquo;find it, fix it and move on&amp;rdquo; mode is a big step up from the &amp;ldquo;fix it when it breaks&amp;rdquo; mode, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t look or feel like great improvement, so many get discouraged and tend to look for faster, more rewarding opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is where the maintenance planner can really make a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An item I emphasize in maintenance planning and scheduling classes is the importance of the planner. One of the planner&amp;rsquo;s first activities on the job is to check to see if we&amp;rsquo;ve done this work before on this or similar equipment. If we can get the planning information from previous work (even copy the work order), a huge amount of the planner&amp;rsquo;s time is saved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s a big improvement for planner productivity and accuracy, but what&amp;rsquo;s a huge plus for maintenance and operational improvement is that now the planner is looking at the number of times the same work has been done before. This tends to raise the questions of why and what can we do about it. That way, we don&amp;rsquo;t just keep making that same repair over and over again. We get folks together and work on it. Usually, it&amp;rsquo;s an operational or equipment care gap that we can fix pretty quickly. Now, we really start to get better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I remember a case of a motor that kept burning out every six months or so. It was a small motor, and someone different was always making the fix on a different shift. It was a pretty quick replacement, so it took a while to get noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A sprocket had been replaced on an emergency repair, and since the right one wasn&amp;rsquo;t in stock, the closest one was substituted. No follow-up work order was written to make the right replacement. The motor was overloaded, but not tremendously, so it took a while to die. Of course, it seemed that we were always replacing small motors anyway. Therefore, why would this one stand out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, if you search for that work in a CMMS system, the list of occurrences jumps up right away, and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty obvious we need to ask why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The big issues in plants are usually well-known and as a result have a somewhat reasonable chance of getting attention. But the planner is really the only one looking at all the repairs and is likely to see patterns in the smaller ones. Routinely finding and fixing small items is a key indicator of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Still, using history requires a few things, the biggest of which is a value for using history. As a society, we&amp;rsquo;d rather jump in and just do it and not &amp;ldquo;waste time&amp;rdquo; researching because &amp;ldquo;this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different.&amp;rdquo; So managers need to encourage planners to do this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also, there&amp;rsquo;s concern that if we don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, we&amp;rsquo;ve wasted that research time. Yet it doesn&amp;rsquo;t take that long. Besides, we&amp;rsquo;re learning what information needs to be there and can fix work orders that aren&amp;rsquo;t clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The quality of the information is key. The 60- or 80-character work description is the most significant information seen when a work order listing is pulled up. Therefore, that needs to tell the story clearly. A work request description often states an issue, but the final description should describe the actual work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Something else I recommend is routinely visiting completed work orders to make sure all useful information is captured. Unfortunately, completing paperwork does not have the same value for all personnel, and everyone does not know or understand the use and significance of the various work order fields. Besides, it&amp;rsquo;s always useful to actually talk to mechanics to find out how things went and what could have been better in the plan. That&amp;rsquo;s how we get better at planning, too. Effective planning is always a team activity.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Unleash the Power of Your CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A properly configured and utilized computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) is a foundational element of every successful maintenance and reliability program. However, implementing this technology by itself will not ensure that users will achieve greater efficiencies or maximum value from their investment. Trying to obtain value from technology alone is like trying to stand on a three-legged stool that is missing two legs. The other two critical items (legs to this stool) are well-designed work processes and engaged people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We as a maintenance and reliability community need to educate our management and co-workers on the benefits and potential value a CMMS brings to the entire organization, not just the maintenance department. Empowering and encouraging the plant staff to learn how to use this critical tool can pay huge dividends in improving plant performance and increasing the efficiency of maintenance and reliability programs. Through better analysis of asset failures, resource utilization and lost opportunity costs, a CMMS helps simplify the process of implementing value-added maintenance strategies that focus on failure elimination and risk mitigation on assets having the greatest impact on plant safety and availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We also need well-designed work processes that focus on utilizing the features of our CMMS to document maintenance activities in support of the above-mentioned analysis with a strong emphasis on accountability to ensure consistent and accurate data entry is performed. Although inventory and spare parts management is an important integrated component of a valuable CMMS, this article will focus on the value that can be realized when the equipment and work order components are optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A key point to remember is that the CMMS is only an enabler for an engaged work force utilizing well-designed work processes. You must consider and develop all three of these elements &amp;mdash; technology, processes and people &amp;mdash; if you want to achieve value from your CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	You Can&amp;rsquo;t Manage What You Don&amp;rsquo;t Measure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Those of us who use our CMMS as nothing more than an electronic work order system are truly missing out on the benefits of capturing and analyzing powerful data that can be communicated throughout an organization to impact key business decisions involving the operations and maintenance of a facility. Any number of user-defined metrics can be supported by data extracted from a CMMS and then utilized by maintenance and reliability professionals as well as plant leadership to manage assets and resources (both personnel and capital) with the common goal of operational excellence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Metrics can be designed to reveal things such as whether current maintenance strategies add value and are effective; the financial impact of asset reliability associated with equipment failures and lost opportunity costs; labor and cost data associated with particular plant areas, systems or asset types; asset failure history by asset type and cause of failure; or the number of reactive maintenance labor hours versus the number of proactive maintenance labor hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The key to obtaining meaningful information from a CMMS is to define your objectives, consider the data that would support those objectives and build/edit field names and attributes within the CMMS that can be used to provide important performance data that reflect progress toward your established goals. Some common examples of attributes necessary to organize CMMS data for analysis include work type (corrective, preventive, predictive, etc.), work priority (1, 2, 3 or A, B, C), asset group (pump, fan, valve, etc.), asset type (centrifugal, vane axial, etc.), failure codes (bearing, impeller, coupling, etc.), as well as other key work attributes to address environmental controls, process safety management, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When configured with some of these key attributes, the CMMS becomes an essential tool in the documentation and analysis of equipment and work history that can improve our ability to identify and understand equipment failure and maintenance work-flow characteristics that significantly influence maintenance focus and strategy development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you are currently in a reactive maintenance mode, the ability to mine data from a CMMS that supports a simple Pareto analysis to identify at first glance on a macro level where the majority of your labor hours are spent (Figure 1) or where the greatest maintenance and/or lost opportunity costs exist is a solid first step. You can then follow up with a deeper look into the specific assets that are the major contributors and quickly drill down to the underlying causes. In the end, you can make more informed data-based decisions that will positively influence asset operating procedures, maintenance strategies, engineering designs or purchasing requirements focused on eliminating the observed failure mechanism and its negative impact on personnel safety and the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This simple and efficient analysis process is possible because we took the time to configure the CMMS in a manner that would support our desired objectives, define and implement the work process and data-entry requirements for work-order completion/closeout, and develop an engaged workforce through effective communications and training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/5bbe3ad9-11f4-41c8-8282-4f439a850b5d_Figure 1.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 413px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having the proper attributes configured in a CMMS is also extremely helpful in measuring the performance of various areas within the maintenance work-flow process. For example, if you wanted to measure the overall effectiveness of your preventive maintenance program, you would need to consider what might be an acceptable goal and then look at how you would define the metric and data requirements to accurately measure performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this example, you want to consider work type and work priority categories to ensure you have the correct attributes to search or query from in the CMMS work history. A work type of PM (preventive maintenance) and CM (corrective maintenance) are required for this metric. You must then consider a work-priority scale that will differentiate emergent work orders that impede scheduled maintenance activities versus those that allow for orderly planning and scheduling at least one week in advance. You will also need to utilize the total number of labor hours required to complete these maintenance tasks as entered on their respective work orders when they were completed and closed out in the CMMS. You can then select your query date range for one month, one year, year-to-date, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PM effectiveness can be defined as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/a0262c71-b49a-4aa9-a925-934e82c6c4a3_Formula 1.jpeg" style="width: 634px; height: 97px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a query of the CMMS work history by work-order types, work priority and labor hours for the previous month indicated that there were 1,225 hours associated with PM work orders and 275 hours logged against emergent priority (i.e., priority 1) corrective maintenance work orders. With this information, we can then use the formula above to calculate the PM effectiveness for the month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/60cea7ee-a5cb-49d1-8037-8464a11dd63f_Formula 2.jpeg" style="width: 581px; height: 92px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This monthly PM effectiveness can then be factored into a cumulative year-to-date figure that communicates the overall PM performance for a given time period, i.e., year-to-date (Figure 2). This information is instrumental in measuring the impact of proactive maintenance strategies on reactive resource utilization. A lagging indicator at a macro level, this metric can be utilized to manage continuous improvement efforts that target ineffective operating and maintenance practices that have resulted in equipment failures and lost opportunity costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/5c163cc3-6d0d-4a25-8833-716021944cf2_Figure 2.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 347px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In another example to illustrate the value of CMMS data, consider a safety committee that would like to report back to co-workers the efforts being made by the maintenance department to work off the backlog of CM work orders that are flagged as safety-related. A properly configured CMMS with a searchable attribute field designating the work is associated with the environmental health and safety program will provide an efficient way to capture estimated labor hours to determine the backlog as well as the actual number of labor hours spent performing work on these work orders. This will help communicate what percentage of total labor hours for a given time period was spent on safety-related work (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/2/199875fc-8b0e-48f9-96e5-ab5c5ca0076c_Figure 3.jpeg" style="width: 647px; height: 422px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Assess Your CMMS Utilization&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, there will be skeptics who see a CMMS as an unnecessary administrative burden that takes too much time for data entry and provides very little value when that information is already stored in their memory. Ironically, it is these same people who will inefficiently expend resources, sometimes two or more people and anywhere from one to three or more hours, trying to figure out what was done, how it was done, what spare parts were used or what was discovered the last time a particular equipment anomaly occurred. Even then, in some cases, less than adequate corrective actions are initiated on incomplete or inaccurate information as it was recollected from memory by those involved in the last repair activity that took place six months ago, two years ago or even longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This inefficient method can be compounded by making costly mistakes that result in rework, additional lost opportunity cost and even more severe collateral damage than the original problem. Not only does this scenario reflect a poor return on investment in the CMMS, it adds fuel to the reactive maintenance mode &amp;ldquo;fire&amp;rdquo; and could mean the difference between bankruptcy and being the lowest cost producer in a marginal market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, a CMMS can be an extremely valuable maintenance and reliability tool when you understand how it can be utilized to make your jobs easier and more efficient on a daily basis. It is critical that proper work documentation and closeout be defined in the maintenance work-flow process and its importance stressed to the plant staff responsible for operating and maintaining plant equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you are trying to investigate a particular equipment anomaly, measure and analyze your PM effectiveness or desire to improve maintenance strategies that directly impact plant availability and costs, all of these key business decisions rely on information. Proper utilization of a CMMS provides the means to access this information as a result of proper configuration of the CMMS and accurate, detailed and consistent data entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take a closer look at your CMMS configuration and utilization. You may be surprised at the untapped capabilities and power you find under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/yKeAW4c7EVQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Important Considerations for CMMS Data Entry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When implementing a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) into a facility, one of the largest tasks involved is entering the data into the system. This is a two-part task that first requires the one-time entry of the initial data that has been gathered. The second task is the entry of the ongoing information required to use the CMMS to its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initial data entry is a large task, but making a good commitment to the initial data gathering will make the job easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There is a massive amount of work required between gathering and entering this initial data. After all, there will be equipment data such as model number, serial number, equipment ID, purchase date, installation date, warranty, etc. Included in the data should be information on preventive maintenance on each asset (what needs to be done, how often work should be performed, etc.). There will also be inventory parts information including part number, description, location and reorder point. Labor information including each technician&amp;rsquo;s name and basic employee information also should be incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Make forms to collect all the data you are planning on entering into the CMMS, have technicians fill out these forms, and then decide on a data-entry method. Who will do this job? There are three basic options that can be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using your current employees to enter in the data will work if you have committed them to this project. Using them on a &amp;ldquo;need basis&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t work effectively. Temporary employees are cost-effective and work well especially if the initial data gathering provides them with clearly filled-out forms to follow. Turnkey operations complete the entire implementation process from start-to-finish. Each has its pros and cons, and only you can decide which is best for your situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Next, you need to determine what will be the best method of entering in the necessary day-to-day information that the CMMS will manage. Every time a technician completes a job, the information regarding the actual job done, the amount of time it took, specific parts used and any additional details the technician includes will need to be entered into the system. The two most common methods include having an administrative assistant enter in all of the information or having each technician enter in the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One big misconception is the thought that having one person do the data entry (such as an administrative assistant) will save time and money in the long run. After all, having one person spend one day a week entering in all the information seems easier than having 20 maintenance technicians spend five to 15 minutes entering in each of their information daily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, by having an administrative assistant enter in the data, this requires the technician to record everything on paper. In addition, the time required for the technician to correctly fill out the paper and submit to the administrative assistant could have been used to simply enter the information directly into the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The information may be illegible due to handwriting or environmental issues such as oil or grease getting on the paper. The paper may even get lost&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; At this point, the administrative assistant will need to track down the appropriate technician (which may not be an easy task) to get the correct data. Valuable time is wasted because of the process in place. Or, perhaps the data is just entered incorrectly because of guesswork or frustration. By using paper, there could easily be a backlog of documents that need to be entered, which can lead to inaccurate data analysis as the data is not current.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having the technicians enter in the information themselves allows quicker access to data in the system. The time required to document the data is reduced, along with paperwork. The information is also fresh in their mind and potentially more technically correct than if an administrative assistant is entering in recorded data. One concern employers have is giving technicians the freedom to use computers. That &amp;ldquo;freedom&amp;rdquo; is misused sometimes by the technicians who stay on the computers for hours when entering data should only take a few minutes. But, with the proper supervision and training, this concern can easily be negated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having a solid plan for how to enter initial data into the system, as well as managing the ongoing data entry requirements, will deter confusion later. Review your work process flow carefully to decide the best method that will work in your situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/sUsU_5xxceU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Quintessential Asset Management:    The Road to Reliability-centered Maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Asset-management programs and software are getting a lot of press these days. Every maintenance engineer and his site manager are writing a white paper and/or book about the value of asset management to a company&amp;rsquo;s bottom line. There are measuring tools and concepts galore, all intended to provide an instantly successful maintenance process. Much of this content makes achieving reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) and condition-based maintenance (CBM) sound relatively easy and commonplace. This fosters a misguided concept that RCM and CBM are commodities that can be purchased and implemented in short order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to explain how to gauge where a company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program stands and where its goals need to ultimately lie, we need another catch phrase that is all encompassing of the total maintenance-management-process approach and ultimate goal. How does Quintessential Asset Management (QAM) sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll outline the five levels of asset-management development a company usually passes through leading to more advanced processes such as CBM and RCM to eventually achieve QAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Let&amp;rsquo;s define Quintessential Asset Management as the culture, processes and tools required to efficiently maintain an enterprise&amp;rsquo;s equipment for optimum production. Like anything else in business, it&amp;rsquo;s all about profitability or bang for your buck. Like anything else, there are trade-offs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s wonderful to have real-time data and dashboards at your fingertips when you want to make a decision, but achieving this level of technological sophistication requires discipline over a period of time despite business trends that tend to ebb and rise. Maintenance is not unlike a safety or quality program that might get put on hold or abandoned during periods of slow business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies may cut back and lose top-notch, irreplaceable experience that comes back to haunt them when business picks up, instead of being patient and thinking in the long term. During these slow periods when a company has the available human resources, those who would be process &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; will dedicate themselves to value-added projects like maintenance improvement not only for the benefit of the company but also for their careers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The word quintessential comes from ancient physics as the fifth element that holds the other four elements of earth, wind, air and fire together. Think of maintenance as the fifth element that brings and keeps a profitable asset-driven business together. In modern English, quintessential has come to mean the model of a concept. For example, you may have heard people say Joe Montana was the quintessential quarterback. He may not have been flashy, but he got the job done by being efficient, reliable and interacting well with his teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In embarking on your QAM journey, the first questions to ask yourself are where is your company&amp;rsquo;s maintenance program and where do you want to take it. An enterprise needs to establish a valid benchmark of where it stands, set realistic goals and then evaluate its progress honestly and openly at predetermined intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development and maturity of a maintenance program isn&amp;rsquo;t unlike that of a human being. In its infancy, everything is reactive. The machinery breaks, and the production people are screaming for attention. Since there&amp;rsquo;s not a maintenance history to draw knowledge from, repairs are more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a program advances and the technicians learn the equipment and start figuring out preventative measures, it moves toward adolescence where it needs more structure. Then as technology and information systems around maintenance and asset management develop around automated communication processes and historical data, the challenge becomes the move toward proactively and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When it&amp;rsquo;s mature, decisions need to be made based on experience that can push efficiency even further. It is at this level where RCM (reliability-centered maintenance) can be effectively implemented. A few years of historical data and a comprehensive asset-management software system need to be in place before an organization can begin to decide which equipment is truly critical. RCM methodologies can now be used to maintain equipment while developing trends showing where they might save money by doing less maintenance or even running some equipment to failure. Once these processes are in place with a plan to monitor and further improve them, QAM has been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 1- Disruptive/Reactive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Everything has to start some place, and maintenance is no exception. There is no equipment history to fall back on, and all maintenance is reactive. Some enterprises start manufacturing or servicing products that don&amp;rsquo;t acknowledge maintenance until it literally bites them in the balance sheet. Some welder or machinist will do minor repairs on failed equipment, and service representatives will be called in for major issues. As time goes by, the failures start really creating production problems and can actually cause a viable business to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 2- Folders and Spreadsheets&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level two, companies start hiring maintenance mechanics and might even allow one to sit behind a desk a certain percentage of the time in order to plan maintenance and keep records. It is at this stage that calendar and operational time based PMs are put in place and technicians start keeping an equipment history. Many companies only move to this level to appease some quality standard for their industry such as QS or ISO. Many companies stay at this level indefinitely, perhaps due to a prevailing notion that if a technician isn&amp;rsquo;t turning tools on a broken machine, he&amp;rsquo;s wasting time. More proactive planning and management are not seen as value added items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/5b89ecbe-2f7d-4881-a7e3-f5ffd61072df_QAM1.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 357px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;In this screen shot, notice that the graphical representation of the equipment structure is hierarchical and navigable. &amp;nbsp;The equipment records and work-order screens are scalable. Shown is a more mature representation of an equipment object with documents attached. This can be simplified dramatically to only show the fields and tabs in use.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 3- Basic CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At last, a computerized maintenance-management system (CMMS) has been approved and a team has been assigned to investigate the costs and approaches required to follow through on that commitment. &amp;nbsp;There is support from management for the project, and a few champions have stepped up to take the lead on software selection and implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies make the mistake of paying good money for a CMMS but cut corners on implementation. This is an example of what&amp;rsquo;s called stepping over a dollar to pick up a dime. They consider the time required to collect and input pertinent data as time the technicians could be applying to the equipment instead of realizing you have to put good data in to get good data out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, other well-meaning implementation teams try to do too much right out of the gate. They want to use every available field on a fault report or work order before they even understand many of the key performance indicators (KPIs) they ultimately want to monitor. Letting a system evolve to some extent always makes the best sense. Time is money, and it requires time to enter data in the system. Having a technician fill out a field that&amp;rsquo;s not necessary is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the maintenance system develops, using a particular field may make more sense but is not available because it&amp;rsquo;s already being used and full of impertinent information. Poor implementation also results in a situation where the equipment isn&amp;rsquo;t set up correctly or the information entered into the system is based on guesswork. It makes sense in many instances to be patient and wait for work history to identify needs. A well-designed maintenance program will optimized with age. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You need a plan of where you want to go with the system before you set up the implementation. Lay out phases and goals with timelines. Benchmark where you&amp;rsquo;re at and schedule intervals of honest evaluation. Hire the right consultants to help you. They may or may not be the software vendor. Be sure to have your best maintenance people on the core team who are getting input from the technicians and in-house subject matter experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What to Look for in a CMMS?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Obviously, the first thing you want to make sure of is whether the company providing the software is going to be around for a while and has a structured product-improvement model. You want it to be scalable so your program can grow into the tools the CMMS has to offer, including KPI dashboards, trending and possible real-time data-capture feeds from machine-operation software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Is the input simple and does the navigation feel intuitive? Other important facets are equipment structures that allow quick visibility of cost roll-up. You will also want preventative-maintenance tools that provide scheduled work driven by calendar, accumulated value such as machine hours, and events such as all maintenance due for a shutdown. In addition, it&amp;rsquo;s good to have fault reports that can be put in quickly but have the capability to be followed up with lots of planning detail as well. Equipment history should be accessible quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Along with CMMS implementation, this is a good time to introduce simple, less expensive conditional components such as oil sampling and infrared thermography. A year into a CMMS project and with simple conditional checks, there should be enough information to start developing and harvesting KPIs and trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/ca060a8d-13ea-4324-8948-f3e3af3020b2_QAM2.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 399px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Built-in navigational tools including this PM for Object Structure table enable you to see each the PM for each particular piece of equipment as well as all PMs for the equipment in its structure. IFS PMs can be to the specific object of a route and can be generated in several ways including calendar, criteria data (accumulated values such as hours and cycles as well as minimum and maximum limit values), and events such a planned shutdowns.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 4 - Integrated CMMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In level four, a maintenance organization begins to seriously consider how its CMMS interfaces with other systems in the company, including enterprise resource planning (ERP), equipment monitoring and project-management software. If a maintenance team is cutting purchase orders and doing material requisitions in an ERP while doing double entry by manually recording the costs or actually duplicating them in the CMMS, it&amp;rsquo;s time to consider investing in an integrated package or pay for direct interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a company has been planning ahead in earlier phases of development and selected a software package that offers both ERP and CMMS functionality (called enterprise asset management or EAM), it can more gracefully, cost effectively and efficiently move toward greater integration without bringing in armies of high-priced consultants and systems integrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;If a plant has a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system, it&amp;rsquo;s time to start considering a direct interface of data (hours, strokes, alarms). Pretty much all the monitoring programs and some CMMSs are compatible through OLE Process Control (OPC) interfacing. It makes sense to have remote sampling and real-time monitoring feed directly into the CMMS in order to cut back on the man-hours necessary to collect and enter data and to avoid misreading that leads to junk data in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the integrated CMMS phase, a maintenance organization can also look at integrating its maintenance-software tools with project-management software that can deliver equipment directly into its CMMS. This is a huge step toward greater efficiency and the ability to manage assets over its entire lifecycle from engineering, installation, commissioning, operations, maintenance and straight through the decision to refit or replace. Machine installations, plant expansions and relocations all have asset-management relevance. True Asset Lifecycle Management (ALM), or what&amp;rsquo;s referred to as &amp;ldquo;cradle-to-grave&amp;rdquo; tracking, begins at the design and/or installation level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a42881bb-6163-46fa-a66e-ad8e396d2510_QAM3.jpeg" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 484px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Equipment Object Cost screen shows real-time costs on the equipment with a single click. Notice the Houston facility is highlighted showing the cost of work against the facility itself and the cost against the equipment within its structure. Clicking on any object in the structure will give you the associated real-time cost analysis without running a report.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Condition-Based Maintenance?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A condition-based program can be incorporated into the maintenance program in order to garner value by doing less replacement before failure and requiring less preventative-maintenance hours. We&amp;rsquo;ve discussed oil sampling and infrared thermography, which can be relatively inexpensive. Some other prevalent types include vibration monitoring and analysis, ultrasonic noise detection and non-destructive testing. These are all areas that require specific expertise and assessment on their potential value before implementing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A lot of people want their CMMS to do this specific data collection and analysis for them, but this is impractical. No software can do everything effectively, and you should question anyone who says he can. The CMMS just needs to have the ability to have the data attached to it. Let the specialist specialize where it makes sense and don&amp;rsquo;t fall into that &amp;ldquo;one-size-fits-all&amp;rdquo; pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/7e558402-d205-4eeb-9cb9-05084456225c_QAM4.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 481px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Level 5- Quintessential Asset Management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now you&amp;rsquo;re at the QAM pinnacle. You have all the tools in place to actually implement RCM. You can decide what is truly critical equipment instead of what seems like it would be according to tribal knowledge, but really isn&amp;rsquo;t. You have dashboards and key performance indicators that are real time and at your fingertips. You can make repair/replace decisions quickly and easily. You can make &amp;ldquo;run-to-failure&amp;rdquo; decisions with accurate data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/7/13/a3435b28-608a-40ee-a7f2-ae69ecac13d4_QAM5.jpeg" style="margin: 5px; width: 647px; height: 449px; float: left;" /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IFS Maintenance work orders are seamlessly integrated with IFS projects, which allows an installation, upgrade or expansion project to be planned, created and monitored using IFS Projects while still having the ability to drive costs from work order to the equipment. You can also deliver the new equipment directly into equipment structure using Project Delivery.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	QAM is a model of how an asset-management program develops. You can throw all the buzzwords you want at it, but it comes down to common sense and a plan. While the right technology is important, it is your organizational culture that will really separate the wheat from the chaff and determine if you get to RCM or not. A company needs a vision of where it&amp;rsquo;s going and how to get there, other than a few rows and columns on a budget spreadsheet. The people, processes, dedication and discipline are what make a maintenance program successful. Software, monitoring equipment, reliability premises and performance indicators are just tools that automate, guide and gauge your success.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AS&amp;E Keeps Lean With Sequence Software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As the demand for new homeland-security technologies continues to increase, so too does the competition among private companies vying for a piece of the market. Accommodating customer demands for fast delivery times often is the key to success &amp;ndash; or failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One company thriving in the fast-changing homeland-security market is American Science and Engineering, Inc. (AS&amp;amp;E). The company manufactures sophisticated X-ray products used to inspect parcels, baggage, vehicles, pallets, cargo containers and people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008, AS&amp;amp;E initiated a lean manufacturing initiative that continues to focus on increasing factory output and revenue while improving operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Doug Capri, AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing engineering manager, says the lean initiative looks at every aspect of the manufacturing process. One of the low-hanging fruits identified as needing immediate attention was the way the company documented its manufacturing processes. Capri decided it was time to improve the documentation process with a computerized, paperless system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capri says each step of manufacturing &amp;ndash;including keeping a production record book, test procedures, quality inspections and visual work instructions &amp;ndash;was done manually in a paper-based system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	He says the documentation process represented 1.5 personnel headcounts over an eight-hour shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There was tremendous waste of time and paper,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;We had to manually maintain, audit and laminate each document on a daily basis before we started a build.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, Capri says the paper-based system required several pieces of software to develop the work instructions. &amp;ldquo;We had to use Word and an editing software package for the digital pictures,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;So we would normally take a picture, crop it and then paste into Word. That was very cumbersome and hard to work with.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Choosing Sequence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After a review of potential suppliers, AS&amp;amp;E chose FFD, Inc., a Knoxville, Tenn.-based software company specializing inmanufacturing work instructions for paper and electronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the reasons FFD&amp;rsquo;s flagship software product Sequence was selected by AS&amp;amp;E is because it allows easy capture of AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s core manufacturing knowledge and eliminates the need for an inefficient text editor and a third-party graphics package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Sequence is an extremely efficient tool for knowledge capture, organization and management,&amp;rdquo; says FFD president Barry Lucas. &amp;ldquo;We have put all of the necessary editing tools for text and graphics right at the user&amp;rsquo;s fingertips in an attempt to eliminate whenever possible the necessity of using multiple software packages. Additionally, authors of instructions aren&amp;rsquo;t creating and formatting a document but simply organizing information on a visual process-flow tree. Sequence takes care of the deployment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We were skeptical that the software would do everything we needed,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;So we rolled it out as a pilot project on one product line and then on our more simple and stable products. It went better than expected. Now we use it throughout our plant on all three product lines.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Going Paperless Boosts Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, the 1.5-person headcount once needed to maintain the different work documents has been redeployed elsewhere, supporting the plant&amp;rsquo;s lean initiatives. Capri says the newfound benefits and efficiencies of switching to a paperless system were immediate, adding that AS&amp;amp;E recouped its investment in the software within the first year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From both lean and quality standpoints, we eliminated the need to stop work and wait for an inspector to come to the workstation and sign in,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Now we have a qualified operator verify other assemblers&amp;rsquo; work online. So now we have quality accountability that is digitally logged in the production workbook.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is a very functionally specific piece of software designed to mimic the type of information that companies are accustomed to managing in a manufacturing environment,&amp;rdquo; says Lucas. &amp;ldquo;Before, it took a lot of time to gather and validate manufacturing information from the different systems. Now it is an integrated part of AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s overall business system.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Synchronization with ERP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The paperless deployment capability of Sequence allows AS&amp;amp;E to selectively access information in a controlled and validated manner and present it to personnel on the shop floor. Every work order that is released from the company&amp;rsquo;s MRP system represents a serial number. When a work order is released from MRP, Sequence ties a specific set of instructions to that work order. The work instructions are accessed on the plant floor by work-order number and become the core of their production record book for the customer. In fact, the product will not ship without a report from the Sequence software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There are a lot of visual and visual software packages that create nice, pretty pictures and can do all the graphics, but they have no link to MRP,&amp;rdquo; Capri points out. &amp;ldquo;So if our MRP changes, if we have a design change and the bill of material changes, our paperless system is able to send us an e-mail and it also shows up in our Sequence bill of materials. That feature has allowed us to become more efficient implementing changes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Just as important, AS&amp;amp;E has improved consistent product processes, accountability and traceability with serial numbers to track defects back to root cause quicker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Reduced Time to Market for New Innovations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AS&amp;amp;E also utilizes Sequence software to document and speed up new product innovations, even at the prototype stage. This is a benefit that dovetails perfectly with AS&amp;amp;E&amp;rsquo;s goals of developing options and adaptations to meet specific needs of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Now we can have the framework of a project when we do our first build,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Before we had to wait until the prototype was built and document after the fact.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AS&amp;amp;E uses solid modeling for new product prototypes. Working in a three-dimensional, virtual world, AS&amp;amp;E can complete work on the model before ordering parts. Photographic images captured within Sequence give engineers the ability to tweak the design as the prototype evolves. As a result, significant time is saved because of concurrent engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We can determine the manufacturability of a product by using the model,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;We can develop a document even in the prototype stage. That has helped reduce deployment and engineering time by 15 percent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Training &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Because of the nature of the homeland-security business, Capri says some customers require an almost impossible delivery schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Sometimes we have to go to a second shift and bring on new people,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;This is highly sophisticated, custom-built equipment that goes to certain locations because of security concerns. Because operators can see everything on a computer monitor, it helps with the learning curve. This has allowed us to also have a more flexible workforce. We now have a consistent process for moving people from one area to another quicker with less training.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Just-in-Time Learning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Additionally, the paperless system allows AS&amp;amp;E to implement lean changes more quickly than a paper-based documentation system. Capri says if a new way to improve efficiency is found in one assembly cell, it is easily adopted into the Sequence software system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We have a value-stream mapping process,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;If the guys on the plant floor come up with a new way to do something, we can document that very quickly and release it to the next work group quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Simplified Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These changes, as well as the entire production record, are instantaneously available to Department of Defense (DOD) inspectors as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The old production record books were handwritten,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Now we&amp;rsquo;ve implemented barcode readings to record serial numbers right into Sequence. That reduces the chance for error when we get audited by DOD.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Capri says the company&amp;rsquo;s lean initiative is on track for even more improvements, but the bottom line is this competitive international market oftentimes comes down to cycle times and deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Sequence is part of the overall process that has helped reduce cycle times by two weeks,&amp;rdquo; Capri says. &amp;ldquo;Our customers want the products right away, and if we can&amp;rsquo;t deliver, they will go to somebody else.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/tTGLdeg-ibw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tango Mobile Offers Equipment History Documentation Through Smart Phone or Tablet Technology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Bringing convenience and mobility to industrial maintenance, 24/7 Systems, Inc. now offers Tango&amp;trade; Mobile. Tango&amp;trade; software on a smart phone allows plant personnel and managers to retrieve information about plant equipment stored through Tango&amp;trade; Reliability Information&amp;nbsp;Management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One problem with asset information is that the asset and its reliability information are located in distant areas. To look up or enter asset information, technicians must leave the asset and go to the computer inan office to access the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tango&amp;trade; QR codes can be installed on equipment by plant personnel, contractors or repair vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Quickly scan a QR code with Tango&amp;trade; Mobile and instantly view the following information:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Condition Monitoring History&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment Repair History&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Equipment Design Details&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Linked Documents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/tango-mobile.jpg" style="margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 7px; float: left; width: 200px; height: 197px; " /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Authorized Tango&amp;trade; users may connect to the plant&amp;rsquo;s Tango&amp;trade; database. With the appropriate level of permissions, a user can trigger several actions to enter condition status information, search for replacements in inventory, and enter condition information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	24/7 Systems provides web services focused on managing lifecycle history and condition information for industrial equipment at more than 250 industrial plant worldwide. Tango&amp;trade; Reliability Information Management provides a single web hosted database for integrating and analyzing plant equipment reliability information. Information gathered through Tango&amp;trade;, Tango&amp;trade; Mobile, Repair Tracker&amp;trade;, and Oilography&amp;trade; is used to report and measure equipment reliability throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tango Mobile&amp;trade; is the latest release from 24/7 Systems, Inc. and joins the family of Tango&amp;trade; Reliability Management solutions. A Tango&amp;trade; Mobile Quick Start Guide is available at &lt;a href="http://www.tf7.com"&gt;www.tf7.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/54UgecXb7u4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Will you be the next BP?: How to avoid a catastrophe at your plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	From news reports on the Congressional testimony, BP, Transocean, Halliburton and Cameron are all pointing fingers and trying to shift the blame for the blowout that set fire to Transocean&amp;rsquo;s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig. At some point, we may know the real root causes that created this disaster. As it should be, this disaster is destined to become another textbook case study that you will be hearing about for the next 15 years or more on the industrial front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If you haven&amp;rsquo;t already begun to reflect on how a crisis situation could affect you, you had better start giving it some serious consideration. While you may not be at the level to testify at Congressional Hearings, if your CEO is forced into this situation, you best believe that you will be feeling the pressure down at your management level and beyond. Remember, the stuff always rolls downhill. For what may be years to come, all of these companies are and will be getting a lot of &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; from people that they aren&amp;rsquo;t really prepared to have poking around in their world. In addition to Congress, they have federal authorities like the Coast Guard, and the Minerals Management, hordes of attorneys that represent the companies and those impacted, and the news media. There is even an article on the Washington Post Web site entitled &amp;ldquo;How to sue an oil company&amp;rdquo;, where an attorney who represented Native Alaskans after the Exxon Valdez oil spill tells all. He notes that there were 10 million pages of documents used for the court case. You can believe that included tons of maintenance information, such as snapshots from the controls DCS system, failure modes and effects analyses, and CMMS records like preventive and predictive maintenance activities, repair costs, material issues, and work order histories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OK, so your company is not BP&amp;hellip; I hear you saying, &amp;ldquo;Jeff, this scale of thing couldn&amp;rsquo;t happen to us.&amp;rdquo; Don&amp;rsquo;t be na&amp;iuml;ve; all it takes is one attorney or journalist to unleash your own nightmare. While you may not have the scale or commodity to unleash an environmental disaster over the Gulf of Mexico and possibly the Atlantic Ocean, your organization is at risk no matter what you do. I encourage you to go back and read &lt;a href="http://www.mt-online.com/component/content/article/255-september2009/1366-lawyers-and-computerized-maintenance-management-systems.html"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; where People and Processes was involved in providing expert analysis to determine the levels of maintenance that occurred in a manufacturing facility before the sale of the facility to another company. I can almost guarantee that the prior maintenance group never thought that the CMMS data would be reviewed and used in a court of law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now that I heightened your awareness, let&amp;rsquo;s give you some thoughts to consider. Do you have processes in place to determine the root causes for equipment downtime and quality issues? I trust you have them already for health, safety and environmental issues. The questions you should be asking in addition to &amp;ldquo;do the processes exist?&amp;rdquo; should include &amp;ldquo;What do you do with the output or findings?&amp;rdquo; Are you inspecting and auditing to make sure identified actions happen and that you resolved the issues? Are you doing autopsies on failed components? Do you truly understand how and why the item failed? I&amp;rsquo;m not just talking about the ones that have painful consequences, but the lesser ones, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the BP/Transocean blowout preventer, there are 260 failure modes. Have you taken the time to do failure modes and effects analyses on your equipment? Just because you have identified the failure modes doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean the right maintenance is being done to ensure the item doesn&amp;rsquo;t fail. Do your proactive maintenance practices look for and address those failure modes? Are you inspecting to make sure the processes are working and the work is not pencil-whipped? Is the work done at a precision level? How do you know? Are you relying on tribal knowledge for the answer?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Does your CMMS/EAM accurately reflect the work done along with materials and labor used, and the costs of the repair? Do you have a CMMS code that identifies corrective actions resulting from proactive maintenance activities? In other words, does the PM/PdM program add value? Are you capturing all of the work in the CMMS? Is the work completed in a timely fashion once identified or does it linger based on funding levels, etc? &amp;nbsp;Are checklists in place for operations to ensure correct equipment operation? Are those checklists followed? Does continuous improvement and optimization happen based on data from the CMMS?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The bottom line is that YOU need to put on a different pair of glasses and look at your organization, processes and inspections like a government regulator or, better yet, an attorney who is out to make a killing on your mistakes or missed opportunities. Take nothing for granted. Everything matters, even the little stuff that can add up in series to become a much larger issue. This is where the inspections and audits come in. Make the time to dig deeper with these glasses on. You may be surprised at what you find. If you don&amp;rsquo;t find anything, you aren&amp;rsquo;t looking hard or deep enough. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know what steps to take or how to get there, get help. Don&amp;rsquo;t be the next &amp;ldquo;breaking news&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/7KvZxX8Wxq8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tips on maintaining the maintenance spare parts database</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	I often see groups really struggling with managing their spare parts data due to years of neglect and lack of ownership. On the initial CMMS implementation, the data may have been properly described with a noun/qualifier/qualifier approach for the short text description. As time passes, people move on and someone else takes over the database.&amp;nbsp;They may not receive training or understand the naming concepts. Soon, the users of the data can&amp;rsquo;t find the parts housed in the storeroom due to the way items have been named. The storeroom inventory value goes up, too, as parts become duplicated since no one could find the stocked item. So, how do you straighten this mess out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Depending on the number of items, it may be simpler to opt for a data-scrubbing exercise by a third party. Before I describe this process to you, let me prepare you for a little sticker stock on the cost. Expect to pay somewhere between $3.25 and $4.50 per SKU (stock-keeping unit), depending on the services rendered. So, 30,000 SKUs will run you roughly $100,000 to $135,000. If you were unsuspecting, you can pick yourself up off the floor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In general terms, here is how the data-scrubbing process works. You provide a database listing of all of your SKU information &amp;ndash; like manufacturer, model number and short text description &amp;ndash; to the vendor. The vendor will already have a data dictionary that it has built over time with all of the parts it has scrubbed to date. This is usually a pretty comprehensive listing; but if you are in the railroad business as an example, the data dictionary listing for those parts may not be as extensive. The vendor will typically work with you to customize the data dictionary when required. The database of SKUs that you provided is then compared against the data dictionary. You end up with direct matches, close associations and complete exceptions. The close associations require another pass from a human to verify and correct as required. They may require field inspection. The exceptions do require field inspection to address and correctly describe. As an example, a short text description of &amp;ldquo;Item 2 from Drawing 234563-2&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t cut it. Can you tell me what part that is; is it a shaft, or a spindle? For what piece of equipment? It might be an SKF 6207-2RS1 bearing, but how would you know from a description like that? So, there is an on-site component to the data-scrubbing effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once this effort is complete, the vendor provides you a database that is loaded back into the CMMS. You can ask the vendor to identify duplicates for you. In addition, it can provide a more comprehensive inventory analysis, if needed, based on (for instance) stocking levels and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, the real priority for you is to put processes in place and audit to ensure you never end up in this situation again. You need to do this before you load the scrubbed data. That means that you really need a gatekeeper or two trained in creating the short description text as an example. After all, you just spent $135,000 of the business&amp;rsquo; money to scrub this data. But wait, you are not done yet. Now you should be looking at the storeroom inventory to rid yourself of the duplicates, if not already done so, and optimizing the items stored. This means (for example) determining the need to stock, at what quantities, and what reorder points.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>A poem about plant maintenance (you need to read this!)</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Maintenance evangelist&amp;quot; Joel Leonard forwarded this poem to us at Reliable Plant. We thought it important enough to share it with you. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jotun maintenance poem&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So Maintenance is a cost, so you say,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Please look at things, another way,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With maintenance correct, your systems run fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;There are great reductions, in your breakdown time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So if you are talking, just maintenance cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Think of those breakdowns, and what you have lost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Production, a deadline, maybe a customer too,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Surely you see, that&amp;rsquo;s a bigger cost to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So now let&amp;rsquo;s consider, our CMMS,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;On its own it&amp;rsquo;s something, but still not the best.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;However, with planned, and predictive maintenance as well,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s sure to reduce, all that production breakdown hell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Then train our operators, on what parts to clean,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Autonomous maintenance, now is that so obscene&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Machinery do they know, what operating parameters are set&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure if you ask them, they will say NO, that&amp;rsquo;s a bet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;So in conclusion, hopefully you can see,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Maintenance as a cost, a complete fallacy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;But to optimise it fully, we need a different attack,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;With correct tools in your toolbox, there&amp;rsquo;s no turning back&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Train up your operators, these misunderstandings they cost.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Then between us all, we&amp;rsquo;ll reduce your running time lost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Optimise your maintenance, start your journey right now,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;Its something to embrace, come on use your, know how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Survey to examine trends in enterprise asset management</title>
            <description>&lt;div class="ExternalClass50FF6297A11A49EDB25B602F813868A2"&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		The impact of the information explosion combined with mobility is profoundly larger than previously thought.&amp;nbsp;Your help is needed to assess the changes. This ARC Advisory Group survey for enterprise asset management (EAM) trends examines current and future expectations for maintenance practices, EAM functions, mobility and inventory optimization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Who should take this survey: &lt;/strong&gt;If you are involved in the maintenance function, you should take this survey.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Why your participation is important:&lt;/strong&gt; The survey results provide a guide for assessing new functions, application integration and emerging technologies.&amp;nbsp;The results can be used to add credibility to your proposals.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		Also, the report is used to guide future application development.&amp;nbsp;Your &amp;ldquo;vote&amp;rdquo; impacts the EAM community.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Privacy:&lt;/strong&gt; Your privacy is assured and your personal identification will not be released to others. No individual or company will be identified in the report. Your response is accumulated with others to chart the results. Only aggregated information is published.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of taking this survey:&lt;/strong&gt; You will gain a valuable external perspective from your peers who are involved with maintenance. Those who complete the survey will receive a free copy of the final report ($1,295 value). Also, within a week, you will be sent last year&amp;#39;s report from a similar survey.&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Link:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e34hos8rggcg4mib/start"&gt;http://survey.constantcontact.com/survey/a07e34hos8rggcg4mib/start&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
	&lt;div&gt;
		The survey is Web-based and should take about 30 minutes during the course of a day.&amp;nbsp;If you know someone who would be interested in this survey, forward this to them.&lt;/div&gt;

            <title>What reliability-improvement tools should I invest in?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When I started in maintenance, I loved looking at the tool catalogs and, of course, imagined how nice it would be to have one of those gigantic tool sets. You know, the tool set with something for every job. Similar to most of the other new guys, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford to purchase that kind of tool set and had to settle with a much smaller one. Over time, purchasing tools to increase my toolbox capability was based on need and understanding of the function of the tool. This proved to be a great way to learn how to use my toolbox. If in the beginning I was able to purchase the dream set, I probably would not utilize half the tools because I would find myself overwhelmed and sticking to the core tools I understand and occasionally running across something that I might find a use for. That would have not been a very good investment. By investing in tools as I understand their function, I am able to get the most out of them and they will get used because I am more aware of them being there by the &amp;ldquo;new toy&amp;rdquo; attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Management and improvement tools are the same way. It is easy to dream of having a facility with all of the tools working harmoniously together and being utilized to their fullest extent. The problem is this rarely happens. Most successful programs start with the choice of one or two core tools and then add on as function and need permit. This allows people time to get to understand the tools and develop habits that are effective in application of the tools. As time goes along, those people are better equipped to be able to adapt to more tools in the toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I have seen many horror stories in the making of companies who think that throwing money at problems automatically makes them better and eventually leads to trouble-free bliss. Throwing money or resources at problems often causes more confusion and inefficiency. An example of this is a situation where I watched a maintenance manager and a maintenance supervisor replacing buckets on a standard bucket elevator that would normally be a one-man (or possibly two-man) job. The problem is that they were being watched by two Class A mechanics and one Class B mechanic (yes, three very experienced techs), who were providing the tools for the manager and supervisor to use. Inefficiency has no limitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You might ask, &amp;ldquo;What is the right tool for me to start with?&amp;rdquo; I recommend finding out what your biggest headache is and find the tool to fix it. The tools can range from standard management tools to advanced tools that are designed to deal with a specific issue. One area I recommend before undertaking a bunch of the other tools is a good computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). This will provide a good foundation for some of the other tools to be added on. Another recommendation is to implement a reliability program of some variant prior to starting some of the predictive maintenance tools because it may help you determine what predictive tools you need or want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These are just a few of my thoughts. What are some pieces of advice from others who have dealt with management and improvement tools?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/YQoa9rhZBlM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>7 tips for selecting asset management software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Sophisticated enterprise asset management (EAM) software is a must for companies with business models that rely on maximizing output of expensive and complex assets. The right EAM software will help you not only ensure asset availability by seeing that necessary maintenance is performed, but allow senior management to manage and protect their overall investment, be it in an offshore drilling platform, nuclear power plant, manufacturing facility, jet aircraft or other asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The seven tips included in this article are from some of the top EAM minds in IFS North America and IFS AB, and are designed to help ensure that you get the most out of EAM software so that you can get the most out of your assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Consider PAS-55 and demands it places on EAM.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	PAS-55 is a new publically available standard for asset management from the British Standards Institute, and is making rapid inroads globally. PAS-55 can be a great way to prove to stakeholders like customers, stockholders, regulators and customers that you are following best practices to ensure reliable operation, control costs and maximize return on capital assets. This standard deals only peripherally with EAM software, but does place one major requirement on information technology systems used to manage asset data that ought to impact EAM software selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PAS 55 requires that IT systems used to manage asset data allow for sharing of information and the retention of knowledge across the organization with a special focus on outsourced activities. Specifically, EAM must address all phases of the asset life cycle, including the processes of planning and engineering of the asset, maintenance and operation of the asset and the eventual retirement or decommissioning of the asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to facilitate compliance with PAS-55, EAM and other software used to manage asset data needs to deliver an accurate and consistent view of all asset information &amp;ndash; one version of the truth &amp;ndash; insuring policies, plans and actions are based on an accurate understanding of the history and current status of your asset infrastructure. In order to accomplish this, an EAM software product must actually address all phases of the asset life cycle, and not many do. It must also provide portals or other methods for outside parties like engineering firms and maintenance contractors to use the system so that everyone touching that asset data is interacting with a single database in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Whether you plan to immediately implement PAS-55 or not, full asset life cycle support ought to be something to look for in an EAM software selection cycle. It is one best practice that makes measurable and practical sense in managing the life cycle of capital assets. And you never know when PAS-55 compliance will appear on your organization&amp;rsquo;s agenda, perhaps at the bequest of customers, investors and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Open your system to your contractors with simple technologies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	PAS-55 compliance is not the only reason to open your EAM application to suppliers like engineering firms and maintenance contractors. There are two more reasons that this is a good idea. First of all, as you plan maintenance work for the weeks ahead, if your contractors have visibility of your plans through your EAM system, they can be informed of the upcoming work, schedule their people and ensure that they have the right tools and materials available. If they are seeing that rolling schedule, they can be more responsive to your needs. This also reduces the amount of time necessary to manage those outside contractors by phone and e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moreover, if the contractor can report their work activities directly into your system, you are getting real-time updates of work completed. That eliminates the delay that results when the contractor enters the data in their own system, and the data flows through reporting mechanisms within that contractor environment and back to the manufacturing maintenance team, which then has to enter that record of work back into the EAM, enterprises resources planning (ERP) or computerized maintenance management (CMMS) software. That repeated entry is wasteful and increases the likelihood of mistakes. Real-time data can also allow for tighter coordination between the contractor and internal maintenance staff or with other contractors working on that asset. Moreover, that real-time data could allow for more efficient use of the asset, as in the resumption of a production schedule immediately after a contractor finishes work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Anyone engaged in an EAM selection process ought to ask hard questions about how the software can be extended to suppliers involved in the various stages of the asset life cycle. Are there different ways this can be achieved that work for the various outside parties that should be able to access your EAM system?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Consider the importance of project management on a macro level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	If you think of the life cycle of an asset as one long project &amp;ndash; a project that might last for as long as 20 or more years &amp;ndash; it becomes apparent that what you are really looking at is a project that starts with the engineering and construction processes. The project then comes to include the cost to maintain, operate and refit, and culminates with a well-informed decision to decommission and replace the asset. In the absence of fully functional, flexible and integrated EAM and ALM systems, managing the life cycle of the asset from cradle to grave is a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even though asset management technology has made enormous leaps in recent years, in some ways it may have been easier to manage major assets 30 years ago than it is today. This is because years ago, industries tended to have their own in-house engineering departments that designed major refits as well as new construction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What this means to a software selection process is that the ability of an EAM package to support plant design and engineering ought to be a major factor. Even in the vast majority of instances when an outside engineering group is responsible for design, their activities ought to be encompassed by the EAM platform to be used during the asset life cycle so that design data flows naturally into the maintenance and operations systems that will sustain the asset during its productive life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tight integration between ALM, project management and core EAM functionality is also necessary. Consider for a moment the situation faced by the chief executive and maintenance director at a coal-fired power plant that has one stop per year for major overhauls. There is a pressing need to meet the project timeline because each day of downtime is worth millions of dollars, and there is a significant degree of project complexity as outside contractors are hired, equipment is rented and perhaps additional maintenance shifts are added. Robust project management functionality that is integrated on a very granular level with a powerful EAM application can help manage the resources necessary to complete the required tasks in the time allotted. While the ability to manage to meet the deadline is one strong argument for integrated project and EAM functionality, even greater benefit can be realized of project and EAM functionality are tied into an overarching asset life cycle management (ALM) system and the general ledger. The ability to look at a plant shutdown from an ALM and financial perspective can help determine if it makes sense to bring in additional outside resources in order to shorten the amount of downtime. To what extent will the outside cost of hiring contractors and equipment increase total return on the asset in the intermediate to longer term?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many asset-intensive companies do not have in place the proper tools to efficiently optimize the activities associated with a plant shutdown, and certainly do not have the right tools to proactively reduce planned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Asset management executives that get the right EAM tools in place and leverage them to their full extent will have lower overhead and greater productivity, while their competitors fumble to keep up. They will be able to make more intelligent decisions about the life cycle of the asset because they can manage it as one long project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Consider the importance of project management on the micro level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In a large-scale project environment like an asset-intensive industry, an effort to track the cost of operating and maintaining the asset is dependent on effective cost tracking on thousands of smaller projects. On this micro level, integrated project, finance and EAM functionality is critical. When working in a properly integrated enterprise application, it is much easier to structure a maintenance project to collect all of the cost, including procurement and work orders that are used to collect technicians&amp;rsquo; time. Integrated functionality will also allow analysis of project cost by different breakdown structures, and each activity a can be assigned a different funding line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/5694f78a-186b-472b-874e-87b81e5d12a0_IEE-ProjInfo-Gantt.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. In this screen from IFS Applications, a number of project management functions are integrated tightly with the rest of the enterprise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Moreover, because a number of different departmental and functional activities can be tracked against a single project or in the aggregate, it becomes much easier to identify the periodicity of failures in specific pieces of equipment. This can be invaluable information as a maintenance director communicates with senior management during the capital budgeting process. Thorough information on what a specific piece of capital equipment costs to operate can inform a refit-or-replace decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But these decisions are much harder to make when the true cost of maintenance is lost to inefficiencies in administrative systems. Specifically, what are these inefficiencies that can hamstring your asset management efforts? Consider the challenge faced by maintenance teams engaged in a more complex maintenance project, like replacing a boiler system, without integrated EAM, projects and work order capability. This project likely involves internal staff time, contractors, inventory parts and materials purchased specifically for the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If this team is using a stand-alone project management system, they will at the very least have to retrain their maintenance technicians to use projects to capture materials and time rather than using the work orders normally used by technicians for other work. Even if you were to engage in this retraining initiative, project cost reporting capabilities may suffer and senior management still won&amp;rsquo;t have a clear idea of the project cost. Furthermore, forcing maintenance technicians to abandon their familiar work orders in favor of project management software can result in lost asset data. Integration from the work order at the front line to the project functionality at the managerial level to the ALM functionality at the senior management level reduces cost and inefficiencies and ought to be something to look for during an EAM selection process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;A maintenance department is involved with multiple projects every day. Ensuring that EAM software is capable of adequately managing and recording this project data should be a key consideration in EAM selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Consider the impact of an aging/shrinking workforce.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	World demographics suggest that executives in the developed world ought to plan to run their business with fewer people in the future. The 78 million Baby Boomers in the United States workforce are starting to retire, and they will be replaced by a generation of just 50 million people. This creates a structural gap that cannot be ignored. Moreover, this younger generation has a completely different view of life, work and technology than their elders, and their expectations for how, where and with what tools they work will be much, much more stringent. Another interesting aspect of the aging workforce challenge is that it really only applies in the more developed countries. The developing world is still much younger on average than the developed world, with younger generations that are larger than older ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While this generational change will demand more efficient EAM and ERP systems, it will also create a real need for enterprise software to record the tacit knowledge and collective wisdom of a retiring generation of executives, managers and workers. This informal, tacit knowledge is a kind of corporate capital that will otherwise disappear from companies when this generation is leaving the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tacit knowledge can consist of a number of things, including work strategies for certain situations like that stoppage that is planned for mid summer during peak vacation season, the complex redesign project that places severe demands on an engineering staff or troubleshooting and repair of unique and complex equipment. Older workers may even be able to diagnose equipment problems based on the sound machinery makes while it is running. This type of knowledge is hard to contain in the enterprise application, but that is exactly what enterprise software must do in order to help companies successfully negotiate this generational shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Getting this information out of the older generation will be difficult for a number of reasons. One reason is the fact that many people regardless of age see knowledge as power, and believe that if they freely share this information they become less valuable to the company. Proprietary information, in fact, should not be shared in a competitive market, but the real competition takes place outside the company rather than within the company. And when knowledgeable employees keep information to themselves, your company will be at a competitive disadvantage. Enterprise software like EAM will need to help build an environment where people are willing to share, willing to help each other and share what they know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many asset-intensive companies do not have in place the proper tools to efficiently optimize the activities associated with a plant shutdown, and certainly do not have the right tools to proactively reduce planned downtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;Asset management executives that get the right EAM tools in place and leverage them to their full extent will have lower overhead and greater productivity, while their competitors fumble to keep up. They will be able to make more intelligent decisions about the life cycle of the asset because they can manage it as one long project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/ddd4c915-14cc-432a-b705-0631750e6517_TheBoard.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Enterprise 2.0 features like this threaded discussion board within IFS Applications can pull tacit knowledge out of senior employees and retain it within the enterprise application.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Getting this valuable tacit knowledge out of senior people is also difficult because they are at that state of unconscious competence. They don&amp;rsquo;t know that they have something to share or what it is that they know would be valuable to others. If you ask someone to, before they are retiring, sit down with a white paper and write down all of the things they know, it would just not work. However, by leveraging technologies classified as Web 2.0 and Enterprise 2.0, we can get people to share because they are responding to organic, real time requests for expertise. Tools like wikis, message boards and even the traditional threaded discussion group can prompt senior employees to respond to queries from other employees, contribute to articles on important topics and capture that valuable data in the centralized application environment where it can benefit the company going forward. Wikipedia, popular discussion forums and even Facebook are examples of collaboration and information sharing facilitated by information technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;In evaluating EAM software, it is therefore clearly important to look for Enterprise 2.0-type of features that will facilitate this type of open, communicative environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;6) Consider the importance of usability.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	It only makes sense that EAM software functionality that can be understood intuitively, with minimal training and orientation, will offer lower total cost of ownership than software that is more abstruse and harder to comprehend and use. EAM software that is simple and offers an attractive interface will also prompt users to enter more data and interact with the system more frequently, which improves the quality of enterprise data. Systems that make sense from a usability standpoint will become more important as the aforementioned younger generation wields more influence in the workforce. Baby Boomers were willing to engage with enterprise software systems that frankly left a lot to be desired from a usability standpoint. They assumed that there was a good reason to enter the same data in multiple fields or bounce between several screens to complete a single process. The newer generations realize that this is just the result of poor software design, and are likely to complain or just use other systems outside of the EAM environment, resulting in fragmented data and inefficient, uncoordinated processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/99868ac9-8a7b-4fc2-8093-8e9b05125d09_stop codes.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. This screen from IFS Applications creates a visual illustration of production stops.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This can be said of all enterprise software. But in the case of EAM, we are often dealing with tremendous amounts of data, particularly when EAM is integrated with PLCs for automated fault reporting. These very sizable data stores contain &amp;ndash; for the most part -- information on equipment and processes that are well within acceptable limits. A vanishingly small portion of this data, however, is of critical importance and interest because it has to do with equipment that requires immediate attention. Therefore, EAM software must allow managers to separate the boring many from the critical few. A number of graphical formats for representing data &amp;ndash; including tree maps &amp;ndash; can accomplish this very thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/2/quick/85342317-6a78-401e-be98-d2eeeba012ac_tree map.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;span _fck_bookmark="1" style="display: none"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. In this tree map from IFS Applications, the number of faults is represented by size and criticality by color. Users can drill down in the big red squares to find the reasons behind the problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;In selecting EAM software, it is therefore important to look for cutting-edge usability improvements that will streamline adoption of the software in the enterprise and offer enhanced decision and managerial support in suggesting which maintenance tasks are most pressing at a given time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;7) Realize lean maintenance improvements by integrating EAM &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;with ERP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While many EAM packages are capable of standard maintenance planning and work management functions, the fact remains that the success of most preventive maintenance programs relies on securing the involvement and buy-in of people beyond the maintenance department. And that is why it is of critical importance for EAM functionality to be either part and parcel of a system of enterprise software used elsewhere in the business or be tightly integrated with an ERP package used company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A truly flexible EAM solution can either be implemented as a full-blown enterprise application including financials, human resources, manufacturing and other functionality or integrated with an existing ERP tool. The EAM functionality in IFS Applications, for instance, includes standard interfaces to SAP, Oracle applications and other products. Meanwhile, a best-of-breed &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; EAM vendor may offer some degree of integration with a broader ERP package, but the inventory management and control, human resources, document management and purchasing functions are not as tightly linked with other applications because the underlying functionality in the EAM tool is not as robust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Lacking very tight integration with other applications used within the company, an EAM package will create non-value-added work as some data has to be manually transferred from the EAM system into an ERP system. Furthermore, when EAM software does not integrate with other functionality like an ERP solution, what results is a suboptimal or redundant system when it comes to ordering spare parts because most purchasing functions are undertaken outside the EAM system. Maintaining good information on spare parts in inventory and avoiding over-buying of components is extremely difficult, particularly if some items to be purchased are used in both the manufacturing process and the maintenance process. Personnel scheduling is also hobbled by a stand-alone EAM tool because the scheduling functions in a best-of-breed maintenance application are not integrated with Human Resources software where information about vacations, employee qualifications and other data is housed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EAM solutions that are part of broader enterprise applications can be very robust, in some cases rivaling best-of breed solutions. They will capture failure data, issue work orders, schedule people and materials and purchasing requirements. But unlike standalone EAM systems, these integrated applications can, for instance, leverage the purchasing functionality already resident in the ERP application. When EAM functionality is integrated with enterprise applications functionality used by other departments, when everyone is working on the same platform and on the same data, there are a number of efficiencies that result. And because everyone is working on the same data in the same environment, it is easier to communicate with others on whom a reliability-centered maintenance (RCM) initiative relies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The bottom line: &lt;/strong&gt;What this means to you is that it is important to consider the degree to which EAM software will create a data silo separate from the rest of the enterprise, which in turns creates non-value-added work. Lean maintenance improvements are achievable, on the other hand, when EAM is integrated with the rest of the enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	While every business is slightly different, we at IFS believe that the above tips will prove useful to most asset-intensive organizations most of the time. The underlying idea that runs through all of these tips is that EAM ought to be seen as a strategic asset that can drive enterprise value when selected, implemented and used correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Spans of control for maintenance planners and others</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As you may know, I travel frequently. The first part of the week was no different as I found myself on a flight to Atlanta. I was leafing through a maintenance book when the person across the aisle struck up a conversation. Turns out, he worked as a veteran maintenance supervisor in a large mill where he has worked for the last two years. He spoke about how things were bad from a reactive standpoint and had gotten worse after the mill downsized. As part of the downsizing effort, they had slaughtered some key players and replaced them with some not-so-key players. We talked about how their maintenance planning and scheduling activities were progressing, to which he was disappointed in the progress they had achieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turns out that he had two maintenance planner/schedulers with a span of control of about 1:25, yet he was still doing a tremendous amount of planning and scheduling himself. He commented that the span of 1:25 fell within the best practices guidelines. In addition, he mentioned from previous training that he learned that a planner should be able to plan three jobs per day but the planners were unable to accomplish this amount of planning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After some additional conversation, we came to understand some of the opportunities present at the mill. I bet you could relate to the rest of the story: Management is dysfunctional. The storeroom is in disarray. The CMMS/EAM system was poorly implemented, and if a part existed in stores, you could not find it in the CMMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So, let&amp;rsquo;s look as some possible solutions to help this gentleman. There never is but one silver bullet that will fix this stuff and, often, it&amp;rsquo;s not easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Remember that a good job plan can start out with three items: the crafts required, the estimated hours needed, along with the parts and materials. These three items are an excellent start, provided that you have a process for continuous improvement, also called a feedback loop. When the crafts execute the job, they should write down additional information to improve the plan, such as tools or additional parts required and task steps. When the planner gets this information back, they update the plan so that it&amp;rsquo;s ready for the next use. You might be able to enlist the help of a clerical person (if you are short on planner resources) who does well tippy-tapping on the keyboard. By doing approaching job plans in this manner, you may find that a planner can successfully plan more than three jobs per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of that said, you still may find planning to be a bottleneck if you are very reactive and the supporting systems have not been well implemented. While maintenance planning and scheduling can happen using a paper system over computerized tools, it&amp;rsquo;s still dependent on the supporting structures for success. For example, if your purchasing process is a nightmare, that can slow down the efforts. If the storeroom and materials management areas are poorly implemented and in shambles, that can affect the planning and scheduling processes, as well. There are a number of other factors that can influence maintenance planning and scheduling success, like the support of maintenance supervision. Now you can see why I tell people that formal maintenance planning and scheduling training is only half of the education required. Formal training should be followed up with coaching and mentoring for the maintenance planner/schedulers. This will help identify and enable the removal of obstacles that impede the planning and scheduling processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You also may want to consider reducing the span of control for your maintenance planner/schedulers. The recommended span of control for maintenance planning and scheduling is 15 to 30 craftspeople per maintenance planner. Supervision is recommended at eight to 15 crafts per supervisor. If your organization is really reactive, you may want to focus closer to the 15 craftspeople per planner and eight per supervisor. As you become more proactive, you can always adjust the ratio higher over time to reflect that improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What else could you identify from your world that would help a reader in a similar situation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/C2rRXfLNNtA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Compact Industries blends success with new ERP system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Compact Industries Inc., a privately held company based in St. Charles, Ill., is a recognized leader in the food service industry. The company launched its operations more than 45 years ago with lines of instant coffee, cocoa and soup in &amp;ldquo;heat and eat&amp;rdquo; paper-lined cups. The concept met with instant success, and sales soared. Shortly thereafter, Compact extended the concept to coin-operated vending machines, and sales took another spurt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 1973, Compact&amp;rsquo;s founder, John F. Green III, further extended his business to single-serve instant coffee packets and eight-ounce service bags. Sales jumped to the point where Compact became one of the largest United States importers of soluble coffee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Meanwhile, Compact also become a leading private-label manufacturer of powdered foods and beverages. The company now produces more than 20 lines of custom-blended hot and cold beverages, including coffees, teas, cocoas, granitas, citrus-based drinks and soft-serve products, delivered in a variety of convenient packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compact now derives most of its revenues through contract packaging, providing custom mixes for the many popular food labels in the United States. The company&amp;rsquo;s R&amp;amp;D lab can custom blend to match and improve upon competitive formulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The challenge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With more than 90 custom and in-house blends with numerous packaging options, from single package servings to flexible pouches to canisters, inventory control became a daunting task. Several years ago, the company realized that its predominantly accounting-based software could not keep up with its increasingly diversified manufacturing operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our exploding product varieties turned our inventory control, order entry and order tracking into critical bottlenecks in meeting our customers&amp;rsquo; needs,&amp;rdquo; said Matt Hancher, Compact&amp;rsquo;s information technology director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	After examining several software solutions for its burgeoning business, the firm opted to go with SYSPRO ERP (enterprise resource planning) software. A deciding factor was SYSPRO&amp;rsquo;s ability to accommodate multi-mode production methods, together with strict controls over finance and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Explains Hancher, &amp;ldquo;We found that SYSPRO provided the manufacturing and financial flexibility and control we needed to efficiently manage our private-label and in-house brands as an integrated entity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;The result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	With the installation of SYSPRO ERP in 1997, Compact quickly gained control over inventory and scheduling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Hancher, &amp;ldquo;Forecasts are critical to our business, and SYSPRO provides the purchasing and production scheduling facilities we need to manage our complex process involving both purchased and customer-owned materials. There is a lot of data within SYSPRO, and we systematically utilize SYSPRO&amp;rsquo;s operational and historical reporting facility in all phases of our business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hancher also gives high marks to the system&amp;rsquo;s ease of navigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;SYSPRO is easy to navigate. Context-sensitive right-click menus provide links to related modules and information, plus users can create their own shortcuts,&amp;rdquo; he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Compact also proactively manages both production and customer relations with the help of SYSPRO&amp;rsquo;s automatic e-mail alerts for low inventory, maxed-out credit limits and other events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Compact looked to further streamline operations and enhance customer service through the implementation of e-commerce, it again turned to SYSPRO to meet its needs. Compact&amp;rsquo;s Web-enabled features now include customer-tailored online order inquiry, purchase order tracking, shipment details and on-hand inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Says Hancher, &amp;ldquo;Private-label customers receive automatic order verification as well as purchase orders via return e-mail. The more our customers avail themselves of these online services, the more our customer service staff can focus on proactive account management.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When Compact moved into its 160,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, computers and handheld scanners placed on the manufacturing floor further enabled workers to enter data and track inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Compact is undertaking a lean initiative to streamline operations and enhance customer service, including a 50 percent reduction in order entry turnaround,&amp;rdquo; says Hancher. &amp;ldquo;SYSPRO&amp;rsquo;s flexibility has enabled Compact to make continuous improvements across our entire organization.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/jb6SM6h-2ng" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Mobile assets create a special management challenge</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font color="#4c6e94"&gt;Asset management&lt;/font&gt; has taken on a new luster at many organizations today &amp;mdash; and for good reason. As the economic outlook continues to be unclear, it&amp;#39;s more important than ever for assets to deliver optimum business value &amp;mdash; across the complete infrastructure and at every stage in their life cycles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For organizations with mobile assets, however, that can be a particularly challenging goal to achieve. As assets shift in location from place to place, establishing their status levels, and performing routine tasks like preventive maintenance, becomes significantly harder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That, in turn, leads to many unfortunate outcomes. Operational costs inevitably rise as key assets function less efficiently than they should. Business processes that should quickly be triggered by problematic asset performance (such as work order creation or replacement requisitioning) are triggered more slowly &amp;mdash; if at all. Assets must be replaced more often, demanding not just new capital expenditure but more time and energy from team members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To visualize these issues more concretely, imagine a hospital with an expensive medical mobile asset that, to serve different patients in different parts of the building, is moved from place to place. Unfortunately, this relocation process isn&amp;#39;t tracked as well as it might be. If the asset can&amp;#39;t quickly and easily be found, it can&amp;#39;t perform the tasks for which it was purchased in a timely manner. Furthermore, if this asset should decline in performance or even fail outright, due to ongoing difficulties in locating it and performing routine maintenance on it, the consequences for the hospital and its patients could be truly significant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dynamically track the location and status levels of mobile assets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Fortunately, IBM now offers a compelling new asset management solution that specifically targets mobile assets: &lt;font color="#4c6e94"&gt;IBM Real-Time Asset Locator (RTAL)&lt;/font&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	RTAL tracks assets by interacting with sensor tags on those assets that communicate asset status data (such as location). In fact, the solution supports a &lt;b&gt;wide variety&lt;/b&gt; of sensor tags based on different platforms &amp;mdash; Wi-Fi, active and passive RFID, bar code, Ultrasonic, Infrared, Ultra Wide Band and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Such extensive tag support makes it a relatively simple matter for organizations to select an ideal communications platform for any given asset, taking into account variables such as expected range of mobility, interference/blockage and others. If line-of-sight is going to be a problem, for instance, infrared won&amp;#39;t be a suitable candidate, but Wi-Fi or RFID might. If the asset generates an exceptionally high volume of data that must be transmitted a short distance in a minimum time, Ultra Wide Band will meet that need well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Intelligent analysis and automated events help maximize asset ROI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Once an appropriate tag has been deployed on a mobile asset, RTAL will continually collect and aggregate status information from it. This information is then analyzed via a processing engine that isolates special/target circumstances (such as performance falling below a given threshold, component failure, or the expiration of time needed before routine maintenance is performed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If subsequent action is indicated (such as maintenance or part replacement), that action can, in many cases, be triggered automatically by RTAL based on predefined rules. Furthermore, visualization of mobile asset status and performance is also simpler than ever to achieve, thanks to a central console that can display assets by class, tasks, organizational hierarchy and other criteria. Managers can, at a glance, determine how well all the mobile assets associated with a service or business group are performing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extending the strong business case for RTAL even further is the fact that it also integrates with IBM Maximo Asset Management and IBM Tivoli Asset Management for IT. This interoperable design allows the organization to obtain even more business value from those solutions (should they already have been deployed), by extending their powerful feature sets and cross-domain functionality to mobile assets that were previously inaccessible &amp;mdash; and generating even more extensive insight into how assets are performing against goals and what action is needed in order to optimize that performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rich array of engaging new benefits and possibilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	What are the business outcomes? Longer asset life cycles, higher asset ROI, diminished costs and simplified management and compliance certainly lead the list. But many other compelling new benefits and possibilities can emerge as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, consider the common problem of asset loss (or theft). Think back to the earlier scenario of the hospital with expensive mobile medical equipment; such equipment should only be utilized inside given areas within the hospital that are known to be secure. At present, unfortunately, many hospitals have no easy way to establish when such assets have been moved outside those areas (and are therefore more vulnerable to loss or theft).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With RTAL, that problem disappears. They can easily determine exactly where in the hospital the asset is at any given time. They can also set policies to decrease the odds of a problem&amp;mdash;for instance, by triggering an automatic alert if the asset is for any reason moved outside secure areas. Subsequently, the security team can take rapid action based on the knowledge of the asset&amp;#39;s location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another area in which many organizations would like to see improvement is asset utilization, as well as the quantified intelligence associated with that utilization. How often is a given asset used? Where, physically, does that use tend to occur? Which team members make use of the asset, and under which circumstances? These questions are essential if asset management, in a larger sense, is going to be optimized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here too RTAL can play a key role. RTAL not only generates dynamic data pertaining to asset status and performance; it can also generate customizable reports that reflect how that status or performance changed &amp;mdash; in different locations, at different times or for different durations. This actionable insight helps organizations to ensure that assets are performing up to necessary specifications. It also helps them plan by establishing trends such as changing demand levels and budgeting/purchasing appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Employee productivity will also climb. Instead of spending fruitless time searching for assets, team members can spend it working and actually using those assets. And when you consider employees themselves are mobile assets, another benefit is evident: enhanced employee safety. RTAL can establish just where employees are in the event of a catastrophic emergency, and thus facilitate and accelerate policies designed to keep them as safe as possible by routing them from problem areas to safe areas with the minimum possible risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/2zWGAQMU56U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Why you need world-class motor management and maintenance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ask a manufacturer how long a motor it makes is expected to live, and the response will be something like, &amp;ldquo;20-plus years in the right environment.&amp;rdquo; Ask the same question in a facility that uses such a motor, and the answer is more likely to be, &amp;ldquo;If we get five years out of it, we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy!&amp;rdquo; Why does this discrepancy exist? Why do motors die of an infant mortality instead of living to the ripe old age for which they are designed and built? The answers have to do with the failure to optimize motor management and maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fortunately, in recent years, there has been a shift in philosophy with regard to motor management and maintenance. Companies no longer regard it as a cost center or a necessary evil. Rather, optimizing the lifespan of motor assets is now considered an opportunity. Business owners have come to recognize motor reliability as a decisive variable in overall profitability and competitiveness. Previously, they purchased information systems and software programs to attack the challenge from different vantage points, but until now, technology has not provided a turnkey solution for optimizing the motor management and maintenance processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Four Levels of Software: A Puzzle with Pieces Missing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Now companies recognize that optimal motor management and maintenance brings greater reliability. Greater reliability, in turn, ensures the best return on asset values, as well as less downtime and, therefore, more cost-effective manufacturing. This recognition led to the birth of Reliability-Centered Maintenance (RCM), a coordinated approach to maintenance, communicated through a centralized base and directed toward the overall reliability of assets and machinery. There are four levels of technology that facilitate this coordinated approach. They are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 1: Technology-level software.&lt;/strong&gt; The software in this category has been limited to identifying health concerns with motors. It is designed around widely accepted standards for motor reliability and delivers alerts and alarms recommended by IEEE (the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers) or NEMA (the National Electric Manufacturers Association). These serve as a first level of notice that something is wrong with the motor or with the system in which it is installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 2: Information management software.&lt;/strong&gt; A handful of software tools are available that are designed to organize information about a specific asset so that a supervisor, planner or technician can rapidly identify trends or indications of problems related to that asset. Much of this information amounts to historical data on a motor that allows personnel to track which systems the motor has been installed in and what kinds of problems it has encountered in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 3: CMMS, centralized maintenance management software.&lt;/strong&gt; Best-of-breed CMMS packages provide centralized information management on a company&amp;rsquo;s motor assets in a variety of technologies &amp;ndash; electrical, mechanical, vibration and others. It is the central location where work requests are initiated and work orders are submitted and authorized. The software tracks each asset&amp;rsquo;s work request and work order history so that personnel can look up the status and type of maintenance or repair work currently being performed on an asset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Level 4: EAM, enterprise asset management. &lt;/strong&gt;Top-level recognition of maintenance as a critical portion of business decisions is the driver behind popular business-level software programs such as those produced by SAP. CMMS software is often linked directly to a company&amp;rsquo;s EAM platform so that reliability and return on investment (ROI) of assets can be monitored directly at the highest levels to ensure cost-effective and competitive manufacturing. Some EAM programs include their own CMMS modules, which are, however, not usually best-of-breed software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While each of these technology levels is critical to the overall picture, they only present partial pieces of the puzzle. What has been missing is a turnkey approach to tracking motor management and maintenance cradle to grave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Cradle-to-grave Approach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The ideal technology supports the entire motor management and maintenance effort from cradle to grave, without the need to purchase and integrate several software packages. The process of assuring motor reliability begins with specification. It continues on to quality control upon receipt of the asset, then to proper storage, to pre- and post-installation verification, to monitoring the asset while operational. The final stage of the process is having the right information to recognize when a motor has become afflicted with a terminal disease or is near the end of its life for other reasons. Then the process begins again with a replacement motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;1) Precision specification.&lt;/strong&gt; Cradle-to-grave management software includes a tool for precision specification, a growing trend in motor management. When forward-thinking companies buy a motor today, they begin with stringent specifications to make sure it is the highest-quality motor available in the marketplace. They know that it is more cost-effective in the long run to purchase a superior, highly reliable motor than to pay a low price up front and then waste resources on frequent repairs. A cradle-to-grave approach to motor management includes technology that allows motors to be pre-qualified at purchase to &amp;ldquo;design out&amp;rdquo; potential problems from the start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2) Quality control.&lt;/strong&gt; Quality control is a paramount but often overlooked component of reliability. Motors are sometimes defective upon arrival. As such, much testing, troubleshooting and repair down the road could be avoided with solid-quality control at the time of receipt. The old adage is, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a car that was built on a Friday. In other words, don&amp;rsquo;t buy a motor and count on its warranty, hoping for the best. Starting with a new motor that is 100 percent perfect will increase its long-term life expectancy and decrease reliability concerns with its installed application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;3) Scheduling and tracking.&lt;/strong&gt; Scheduling and tracking are important to the efficient use of a motor in any industrial environment. For example, just like a human body, a motor needs regular checkups and maintenance so that any trends pointing toward a health problem can be identified and corrected or reversed before they become terminal illnesses. Because problems directly or indirectly related to a motor can be very subtle, thorough tracking of a motor&amp;rsquo;s history can identify negative trends. Such tracking must be automated because people are generally too busy with other tasks to keep notes on the history of motors. While everyone has good intentions about maintenance, it is generally eclipsed by other priorities. Further, the population of workers available to perform testing and analysis on motor assets is dwindling, making the need for automated scheduling and tracking that much more vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another important reason for tracking a motor&amp;rsquo;s reliability and maintenance history is to be able to recognize the point of diminishing return. If a motor&amp;rsquo;s problems and repairs are not tracked, investments may be made in maintaining and repairing it when it is no longer cost effective to do so. For instance, if a motor has been rewound 13 times, another rewinding is inadvisable because the motor will be very inefficient despite this maintenance effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fact is that if maintenance activities are not scheduled and tracked, they probably will not occur. Furthermore, in the absence of automated scheduling, analysis and trending of data to identify conditions leading to lower reliability, potential problems will be overlooked, and the plant&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;4) Predictive testing and trending.&lt;/strong&gt; Testing and trending needs to be predictive rather than just preventive or reactive. Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify that important distinction with a medical analogy. Regular medical checkups are predictive in that the findings may predict illnesses. A preventive measure would be taking vitamins on a regular basis to minimize the risk of unhealthy conditions. However, since the body eliminates excess vitamins, it is not necessary to be predictive about taking vitamins, which would amount to taking a blood test every day. Being reactive about one&amp;rsquo;s health would mean to stop eating junk food once diagnosed with a serious medical condition. Like medical checkups, software-enabled predictive maintenance is designed to identify conditions that are conducive to failure or lower reliability, so that they can be corrected to increase the life expectancy of an asset or motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cradle-to-grave reliability software tracks the history of repairs, or mean time between failures, to show faults so that their source can be identified and remedied. Without such historical information, repeated repairs or continual cleaning of a motor may waste a company&amp;rsquo;s resources on correcting symptoms while missing the real disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;5) Tracking installation history. &lt;/strong&gt;Tracking the history of a motor itself is not enough. Turnkey reliability software also tracks the history of the systems in which the motor is installed. This is particularly important when a motor is used in a number of different systems, from fans to pumps to compressors. If a motor fails as part of a pump, is sent to repair, installed in a fan, fails again, is repaired again, installed in a compressor, and fails yet again, it&amp;rsquo;s important to be aware that the motor has failed every time and to know why it failed. Knowing whether it failed for the same or a completely different reason each time is critical to making a decision about its future. If analysis shows that none of the failings are related, the motor may still have 10 years of life and is, therefore, worth maintaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here&amp;rsquo;s an example. Let&amp;rsquo;s say a motor&amp;rsquo;s application history shows that its last failure was due to a ground fault when it was installed in a ventilation fan. A review of the fan&amp;rsquo;s history reveals that all of the last three motors installed in it failed due to insulation to ground. A common fault mechanism has now been identified and can be further investigated. A technician is dispatched to the site and discovers that the motor above the fan is leaking grease into the fan&amp;rsquo;s motor. If the history of the fan and its motors had not been tracked, several more motors might have failed, wasting resources on repeated repairs. Again, it is critical to automate the tracking of where a motor has been and what problems it has encountered so that personnel can focus on making the right decision rather than spending valuable time on analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	New turnkey software at the technology level now enables the comprehensive management and maintenance of motors through all of these important stages of an asset&amp;rsquo;s life &amp;ndash; from precision specification to recognizing when the motor must be replaced. In short, this is cradle to grave. The software also delivers that information to asset management platforms so that senior management can make decisions that will continue to increase the company&amp;rsquo;s competitive edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;A Solution to Last a Lifetime&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As one of the most critical factors in reducing manufacturing costs, motor reliability has to be taken very seriously if a company wants to increase its return on investment in motor assets. Keeping around several spare motors is not a profitable solution to reliability issues. Rather, the answer is a cradle-to-grave approach to motor management and maintenance that begins with thorough specification and qualification and tracks assets and the systems in which they are installed throughout their lifetime. A company that wants to be world class has no choice but to be world class in its motor management and maintenance efforts. Thanks to new turnkey, best-of-breed software at the technology level, the motor reliability effort has just become a whole lot easier.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>EAM's role in managing sustainability in the discrete manufacturing industries</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many companies have initiated wide-ranging sustainability programs. The heightened awareness of sustainability has generated a diverse range of improvement targets. Prioritizing and managing the multitude of ideas requires structure. If you were asked to lead your company&amp;#39;s program, what reporting tool would you use to manage it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a previous ARC Insight, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Sustainability Program Management with EAM&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; we recommended an asset-focused approach for process industry manufacturers, because resources (power, water, steam, air and gas) and emissions flow through assets. Since EAM is already asset-specific, users could extend their EAM applications to include a reporting function for managing plant sustainability and carbon footprint. But what about in the discrete or batch manufacturing industries, where the paradigm is product-specific?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainability for the Discrete Industries &amp;ndash; Bill of Materials &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the discrete industries, sustainability is addressed by end product:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Business processes and internal accounting are product focused&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regulations are often administered by specific end product&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Customers see sustainability (green) on the product&amp;rsquo;s label and have less awareness of the company (unless they cause a disaster)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maddening Mayhem of Manual Data Merges&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Managing a sustainability program requires reports for priority setting, status, and progress against goals. A typical discrete manufacturer sources thousands of parts, routes them through a multitude of fabrication and assembly steps, and has hundreds to thousands of end products. This complexity involves accessing data from a variety of systems which typically requires a &amp;quot;maddening mayhem&amp;quot; of manual data merges. This manual and obtuse methodology lacks a credible audit trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Assessing sustainability for each end product is impractical using manual reporting methods like a spreadsheet. Considering the executive visibility and potential negative media exposure for sustainability issues, &amp;quot;maddening mayhem&amp;quot; is unacceptably risky &amp;ndash; both for the company and the program manager&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sustainability with IFS&amp;rsquo; Eco-footprint Management&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To enable manufacturers to manage sustainability on a product-by-product basis, IFS has developed an ecological footprint calculator, called IFS Eco-footprint Management, within its IFS Applications suite. This tool utilizes existing components within IFS Applications to handle the demands of sustainability reporting. The company modeled this approach after cost accounting, where environmental costs are assigned to each component. Using the bill of material (BOM) structure, these costs are rolled up into the next higher assembly. Additional environmental costs are added for processing the assembly. It accumulates up the BOM structure to the final product for its total sustainability cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	IFS Eco-footprint Management provides a decision- support tool for tracking and mitigating environmental impact. It enables manufacturers to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Track sustainability by product, work center, or other parameters&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Identify the products or processes driving sustainability issues&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Analyze the environmental impact of the complete product lifecycle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Comply with ecological legislation requirements&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Meet specific regulatory values - CO2 emissions for example&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Enhance the brand and mitigate risk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Organizations require a structured tool for effective sustainability pro-gram management. The IFS Eco-footprint Management offers an enterprise-wide, standardized methodology for managing compliance with environmental legislation. With a cost accounting paradigm, all parties can easily understand and accept the results. This type of tool fits the operating and report structure commonly found in the discrete and hybrid industries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>What do your PM tasks really do for your asset care strategy?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Proper asset care is critical to ensure that equipment is available to meet production schedules, support process flows and comply with environmental, health, safety and regulatory requirements. Asset care is the execution of the most cost-effective control strategy to address the predominant failure modes of that particular asset with its operating envelope. The intent of this strategy is to provide the required asset utilization at the lowest life cycle cost while also ensuring the asset makes it to the budgeted end of life. This care could be an operator care task, a predictive technology, a preventive maintenance task or job plan, and even doing nothing at all (run to failure). The asset care strategy is an output of an engineered system that includes a business process, RASI, and a properly configured management information system (Maximo, SAP, etc.) to ensure sustainability of the strategy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Unfortunately, most preventive maintenance tasks lack the detail that will provide quantitative data for equipment history, and they are written without considering failure modes. The solution is to practice Preventive Maintenance Optimization (PMO), using all aspects to write preventive maintenance procedures that are value added, comprehensive, repeatable, organized, and specify a correct duration and interval of execution. Good preventive maintenance procedures will improve equipment reliability and increase predictability of failures. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Here are a few critical success factors to help you evaluate the preventive maintenance tasks in your current program:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Value-Added:&lt;/strong&gt; These tasks should include acceptance criteria and how to properly determine what is acceptable. Measures or meter points also should be used for collecting data that can be trended to determine when condition-based maintenance is required. The result will be the longest useful life at the lowest operating costs. Personnel should see the value in the task, which in turn will increase the likelihood of it being effectively and consistently performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive: &lt;/strong&gt;PM tasks must include periodic calibration of critical components to ensure that the entire system is consistently maintained in near perfect calibration. They also should include periodic adjustment of clearances, drive belt tension, and other power transmission and operation components. Many system components are comprised of belts, gaskets, etc., that have a finite life, and the preventive maintenance tasks must include periodic replacement of these components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Repeatable:&lt;/strong&gt; PM tasks are written so various maintenance technicians are likely to perform the tasks in the same way with the same results. Task definitions must be complete and provide enough details to assure effective performance of the tasks. Tasks should be effectively organized to permit easy identification and use by the technicians. They should include sufficient disassembly and reassembly instructions, and could even include drawings, pictures or other visual aids to effectively perform the tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Organized:&lt;/strong&gt; PM activities consist of multiple tasks that must be performed as expeditiously as possible to minimize downtime. Therefore, all preventive maintenance tasks must be organized into a logical sequence that facilitates effective and efficient execution of the required tasks. In addition, all supporting data (e.g. the task lists, drawings, specification sheets, etc.) must also be organized to exactly match the tasks to be performed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Duration:&lt;/strong&gt; PM tasks should have the correct mean time to perform. The specific time intervals are provided for each task with the time intervals verified by direct observation of the supervisor and updated as part of the planning and scheduling process. Having sufficient supervision consistently present during preventive maintenance tasks will ensure that allotted time is used effectively and that tasks are completed successfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Interval:&lt;/strong&gt; The frequency of the task should be consistent with the original equipment manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s (OEM) recommendation until the likelihood of occurrence of the failure mode the task is addressing is better understood from reviewing work order history or industry data. The correct interval will be reflected in the analysis of breakdown, trouble-call and correct maintenance historical data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once you have all the above aspects covered in your preventive maintenance tasks, your asset care strategy will have the infrastructure in place to support the relentless pursuit of continuous improvement. This in turn will provide the highest asset utilization at the lowest total cost of ownership through improved equipment uptime, increased production output, and decreased labor and material costs. Conversely, if you find that most of your preventive maintenance tasks do not hold up to this scrutiny, then consider an evaluation of the business processes, RASIs, and management information systems that support asset care in your operation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Companies lack systems for environmental tracking, survey reveals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	According to an independent study conducted for enterprise software vendor IFS in the United States, Scandinavia and Benelux, although green measurement is considered important, businesses on both sides of the Atlantic lack the correct systems to track their full environmental footprints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As environmental regulation advances in both Europe and the U.S., businesses are facing increasing pressure from regulators, customers and investors to document and reduce their environmental impact. According to IFS, research data suggest that organizations need to make wholesale changes to their business technology to keep up with these rapidly advancing mandates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study, based on surveys of industrial executives in each region, discovered that over three quarters of companies consider it important to track their environmental profile &amp;ndash; including 83 percent in the U.S., 82 percent in Scandinavia and 79 percent in Benelux. However, nearly three-quarters of European respondents (74 percent in Scandinavia, 75 percent in Benelux) admitted to not having sufficient enterprise resources planning (ERP) software in place to track their environmental footprint. The U.S. fared slightly better, with 47 percent saying they lacked the enterprise software for environmental tracking, with an additional 42 percent claiming limited capabilities for tracking environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Respondents in different geographies answered differently when asked what the most important reasons are for green IT initiatives. In Scandinavia, 35 percent of respondents said the marketing value of green initiatives was the most pressing reason to implement enterprise software capable of managing environmental impacts, outstripping regulatory compliance (22 percent) and cost cutting (19 percent). In contrast, respondents in Benelux and U.S. said that environmental compliance was a more important benefit (36 percent in the U.S., 34 percent in Benelux) than marketing and cost reduction benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More than half of all the U.S. and European organizations surveyed wanted embedded environmental tracking to be included in their existing ERP solutions. However, although interest is high, many could not name ERP vendors that included this specific functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The results of this independent research show that green measurement has re-entered the boardroom as a business priority in both Europe and the U.S.,&amp;rdquo; IFS CEO Alastair Sorbie said. &amp;ldquo;Equally, it highlights that despite the perceived importance of tracking and lowering environmental footprints, organizations remain unable to obtain the necessary information from their core business systems to make this possible. In fact, they remain largely unaware of how enterprise applications, already sitting at the heart of their businesses, can support them in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Environmental issues are becoming increasingly important, not only for customers, but also for the capital market looking to invest in more ethical and sustainable organizations. IFS remains committed to supporting its customers with fully integrated, environmental foot-printing applications that help them comply with regulations, manage board-level risk, reduce environmental impact, and lower costs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IFS Eco-footprint Management tool, an integrated component of the IFS Applications suite of applications, provides organizations unprecedented control and transparency of the environmental impact of their operations. The tool offers customers an enterprise-standard methodology to help them control costs and meet an urgent need to prepare for compliance with environmental legislation and green supply chain mandates from customers.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ralph Rio comments on current trends for CMMS/EAM systems</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;Save Money with Better Asset Management: In this video, Ralph Rio is interviewed at the ARC World Industry Forum Orlando 2010 by &lt;em&gt;Supply Chain Brain &lt;/em&gt;magazine on the current trends for EAM systems from a recent survey.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Enterprise asset management (EAM) systems are used to manage the maintenance of equipment and facilities in large industrial, commercial or healthcare sites. Computerize maintenance management systems (CMMS) is another term commonly used for this type of application.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Study offers snapshot of industry and its new dependence on project management software</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing in the Western Hemisphere has changed dramatically, taking on a project-intensive business model that requires dramatically different management techniques and business software, according to a study released May 14 by IFS North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Due in part to competition from overseas, North American manufacturing can no longer be characterized by long production runs or identical products. The study, based on a survey conducted by a third-party research firm of 341 executives from mid-market to large manufacturers, indicated that 77 percent of respondents were with companies that were extremely reliant on projects due to their focus on short-run, engineer-to-order, and highly regulated manufacturing of high-value products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, respondents reported low levels of integration between project management software and the enterprise software like enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems used to run their business. A full 59 percent said project management software was completely separate from ERP, and another 29 percent reported varying degrees of partial to full integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Many of these respondents commented about the integration projects necessary to get project management and ERP tools to talk to each other,&amp;rdquo; IFS North America president and CEO Cindy Jaudon said. &amp;ldquo;As project management becomes a more and more central discipline for manufacturers of all types, we feel that project management needs to be a built-in part of ERP. Custom integration projects are expensive and risky, so implementing standard software that meets project management needs with few to no modifications will be an appealing option to our customers and prospective customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey data suggests that manufacturers will be increasingly reliant on a new type of ERP software, project-based solutions (PBS). PBS is designed to help manufacturers gain real-time visibility and control of projects they are running, and allows them to manage their entire business more like a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Project software key for manufacturers, new IFS study says</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturing in the Americas has become a project-driven business, according to executives participating in a study conducted for IFS North America and scheduled for release in May, and this carries serious implications for business software like enterprise resource planning (ERP).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gone are the days when the North American manufacturing sector could be characterized by long, repetitive production runs of identical consumer products. Today, rapidly advancing technology and competition from abroad are contributing to shorter product lifecycles, which means manufacturers must devote more of their resources to engineering and design projects. Other manufacturers are focusing on project-intensive industries like capital machinery, infrastructure projects and engineer, procure, construct (EPC) contracting, and are just as project-oriented in their business models as construction contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Survey respondents characterized themselves as being heavily dependent on projects in order to run their businesses, with a full 77 percent of manufacturers placing themselves in categories that would suggest that project management was critical to the day-to-day operation of their business. Another 18 percent said that improved project management processes could help them with critical processes like product launches. Only 5 percent said that projects were not important to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey data suggests that manufacturers will be increasingly reliant on a new type of ERP software, project-based solutions (PBS). PBS is designed to help manufacturers gain real-time visibility and control of projects they are running, and allows them to manage their entire business more like a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The survey data certainly suggests that manufacturers need to invest in PBS so that they can remain competitive in an economy that is characterized not by predictability and repetition, but by rapid change,&amp;quot; IFS North America president and CEO Cindy Jaudon said. &amp;quot;The data also tell us that among these manufacturers, which range from middle market companies to those with billions of dollars in revenue, that there is a generally low level of sophistication in the ability to integrate projects with the rest of the enterprise and with existing ERP software.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study, conducted by a third-party research firm, will be released and made available at &lt;a href="http://www.ifsworld.com/us"&gt;www.ifsworld.com/us&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;this month. For more information, or to request a copy in advance, contact Chuck Rathmann at 262-317-7419.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Manufacturers plan to hire, but need technology to get more out of new employees</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers plan to hire and will need to use a new type of enterprise software to get the most out of new employees as the economy improves, according to a study conducted for IFS North America and scheduled for release in May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One-third of respondents said they planned to hire additional staff, a third said they planned to invest in enterprise software like enterprise resources planning (ERP) to get more out of current employees and another third said they planned to do both. The survey of 341 manufacturing executives also suggested that there is an unmet need for a new type of ERP called project-based solutions (PBS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	PBS is designed to help manufacturers gain real-time visibility and control of projects they are running, and allows manufacturers of all types to manage their entire business more like a project, making it easier to adjust rapidly to change. In the survey, 95 percent of respondents said they expected their reliance on projects to increase or stay the same in the next five years. The majority of manufacturers said they understood the value of PBS for managing capital improvement projects and launching new products. But fewer understood the significant value of PBS for current business processes, including the ramp-up process for newly hired employees or to manage supply and demand shocks due to the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This survey data is encouraging because it tells us that our product direction of recent years towards PBS is the correct one for our customers and prospective customers,&amp;rdquo; IFS North America president and chief executive officer Cindy Jaudon said. &amp;ldquo;It also tells us that we have some consciousness-raising to do about how C-level executives can use PBS to run a more economically sustainable, resilient business. Using PBS, these executives can avoid over-reacting and laying off too many employees as the economy slows down, and can give them confidence to hire employees and return to full or increased productivity as the economy recovers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The study, conducted by a third-party research firm, will be released and made available at &lt;a href="http://www.ifsworld.com/us"&gt;www.ifsworld.com/us&lt;/a&gt;later this month. For more information, or to request a copy in advance, contact Chuck Rathmann at 262-317-7419.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Usability as an EAM selection criteria</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	After decades of continuous development, enterprise-wide applications have come to offer very comprehensive functionality. With sufficient budget and organizational resources, a middle-market to large manufacturer can likely find enterprise software that includes functionality for virtually any business process with which they might be involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But whether we are talking about the broad and all-encompassing area of enterprise resource planning (ERP) or the more focused world of enterprise asset management (EAM), while functionality may be available to meet various needs, what has been lacking is proper attention to usability. Some enterprise software vendors are beginning to pay attention to usability with regard to ERP, but it is equally important in the area of EAM. Within an EAM application, functionality might exist to allow technicians to retrieve and enter data and allow executives to assess asset health, but if these tasks are difficult or time consuming, that EAM system will deplete valuable enterprise resources instead of contributing enterprise value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this article, we will examine the different usability problems manufacturers encounter with EAM software, how these problems drain enterprise resources, and specific EAM characteristics and features that can lead to enhanced usability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disparate systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	By far, the most common usability problems encountered with EAM are caused the lack of fully integrated applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What I see frequently within manufacturing maintenance departments and maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) organizations is technicians a using one-point solution to manage their work orders, scheduling and planning, and an entirely different system to manage their inventory and potentially another system to handle their purchasing. Yet other systems are used to manage human resources, and to track the credentials and availability of people capable of performing specific types of work. Technicians, managers and executives working in two or three different systems are then forced to learn two or three completely unique process flows and navigation schema. This makes systems less intuitive, increases the amount of training necessary, and prevents users from having the time and inclination to fully explore and leverage the higher-end and more advanced functionality their various software packages might offer. Who has time to become a power user of not just one but two, three or more software packages? This is a drain on the professional time of technicians and executives and also ensures that they will not realize the full value or capability of any of the systems they are relying on because they simply lack the bandwidth to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Usability is further reduced when a collection of point solutions are used for EAM because of the potentially huge amount of data re-entry and rework necessary to keep multiple systems current. Almost inevitably there will be some level of double entry, if for instance, on a work order, I used a part that actually needs to be issued by a second system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In some other situations, manufacturers may be running home-grown systems that, as they were developed, expanded and added onto in-house over a period of years, became more and more complex and convoluted. Packaged software can, similarly, grow in complexity over time and suffer from suboptimal design, presenting usability challenges. Some packaged software used for EAM in fact consists of bundled point solutions that have been acquired by the vendor integrated in a point-to-point fashion. Of course, this may eliminate some rework, but still presents the usability challenges outlined above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why usability is important during selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;Maintenance technicians are intelligent enough to figure out the byzantine and confusing EAM systems they might be forced to use, and we certainly don&amp;rsquo;t want to discredit the intellectual capacity of the people who are using these systems. They are after all talented people who have the ability to repair complex systems. But manufacturing companies that employ these technicians did not hire them as computer operators, but rather to use their skills to keep production systems running and to keep capital equipment operable for its intended use. The technician is not employed to serve the needs of the EAM system, but rather the EAM system is there to help the technician get their job done as efficiently as possible, and it therefore needs to be selected because it is the right tool for that job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This means that one main consideration in selecting EAM ought to be ensuring that technicians do not need to spend an inordinate amount of time navigating through the system &amp;ndash; either to find and access the information necessary to perform their jobs or to enter information into the system in the course of reporting on work they have completed. It is essential that a selection committee consider the number of key strokes or clicks that they have to perform to get information into or out of the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Also important to consider is the amount of system-specific knowledge necessary to perform these tasks. How much training is necessary to understand the basics of how the EAM system works? After all, the way things are repaired hasn&amp;rsquo;t fundamentally changed over the last 100 years. Something is broken, and we fix it. The complexity of the capital assets and components we are working on have increased over time, and more recent innovations allow us to gather data that allow us to predict when something is about to break so we can replace it proactively. EAM supports this process by ensuring we are notified that something is wrong, getting a description of the problem, giving us the information necessary to make the repairs and defining what those repairs were including the amount of time spent and the materials and tools used. That information then needs to be visible to others in the organization responsible for finance, maintenance inventories, personnel scheduling and other related disciplines including manufacturing operations. An EAM system needs to be very intuitive and easily understood by anyone who is intimately familiar and experienced with these core processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But in the many maintenance departments I have visited or worked in over the years, I have seen the same suboptimal usability problems again and again that generally reduce an eight-hour shift for a technician to a mere five hours. What I have seen is the technician or planner forced to work in one or multiple systems each time a maintenance event comes up, and whether it is a planned maintenance activity or an imminent maintenance activity, these sub-optimal systems drain time and energy and slow down the repair. After the job is completed, technicians need to take additional time to enter data on the repair into the system, which slows their response time for the next work order that needs to be executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A standard benchmark for availability of manpower across an eight-hour shift is about six hours of productive time. If part of those six hours of productive time is doing computer entry, there is really no way to meet that benchmark. You have now cut into that six hours and now you are potentially 5.5 or even five hours in a shift. That is a productive loss of almost 17 percent! The productivity of maintenance technicians and maintenance planners has gone down because they are expending additional time working as computer operators, which of course is not what they were hired to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a suboptimal EAM system, it is typically difficult to automate data capture using tools like RFID or bar code scanning on handheld devices. This means that technicians need to take long hand notes on pads they keep in a pocket on their coveralls and manually enter that data at the end of their shift. That disconnect between work and data entry creates the opportunity for human error, and by default forces technicians to record their work twice &amp;ndash; once in their notepad and once in an EAM or CMMS system. Separate work management, inventory, human resources and other functions at the very least makes it a lot more expensive to solve this problem as the systems integration challenges become considerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/auer01.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1. EAM software needs to streamline the process of entering data on work performed. Here is the Quick Report In Work screen from IFS Applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to assess usability during software selection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Obviously, the baseline requirement for EAM software usability is an integrated suite that includes the various disciplines and functionality that planners, technicians and executives need to touch. The more complete functionality that differentiates EAM from simple work management or computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Inventory and supply chain management to marshal the parts and materials necessary to maintain the asset.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Human resources functionality to ensure the availability of qualified workers to perform the required work.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Financial functionality so that the entire cost of maintaining and operating the asset can be analyzed and the lifecycle of the asset can be managed strategically.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Integration with manufacturing operations so that scheduling so that maintenance and production scheduling can dovetail gracefully.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sometimes, integration with CRM so that maintenance tasks can be scheduled to allow for urgent customer orders or other needs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once all of these functions are housed in a unified enterprise environment, preferably developed as part of a complete EAM suite, less time is spent learning different systems with different navigational schema. Less time is spent re-entering data. And the unified nature of the functionality makes it easier and significantly more affordable to automate data capture, eliminating a lot of the time that technicians spend working in the EAM system. If they can use a simple handheld device to capture data on parts and materials used as they use them, and perhaps even record their time and make other notations that get entered directly into the system wirelessly, non-value-added work is automatically eliminated and the EAM system becomes easier to use by an order of magnitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Integrated systems and automation can allow technicians to spend less time using the EAM system. But when technicians, planners, managers and executives do need to use the EAM system, they will find it a lot easier if that system mirrors computer functionality they are already familiar with. Almost any EAM system will require end users to go through at least some minimal level of training. But if the overall navigation, look and feel of an enterprise application can borrow key concepts from web navigation conventions, less training will be required and users will more rapidly feel comfortable in their mastery of the EAM software environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course even the web was not the most user-friendly of places before text-based search engines like Google and Alta-Vista. Before search, the web was a place where, in order to find something, you had to already know where it was. That is one reason so many web sites of the 1990s featured &amp;ldquo;links&amp;rdquo; pages. In most organizations, an EAM or ERP system works in much the same way. There are specific screens that users must know about and navigate into in order to query and find various pieces of data. There may even be &amp;ldquo;links&amp;rdquo; pages where people can store links to the screens they use most frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Usability is enhanced when searches become intuitive much like a Google search is today, where you just enter a search string into a single, centralized search engine and the EAM system finds all of the different places that string occurs. This means that you don&amp;rsquo;t need to find the right place in the application to conduct your search, define numerous parameters and hopefully get the information you need. Instead, you can enter a requisition number, customer name, invoice number or supplier name and immediately get appropriate information. Advanced embedded search tools allow you to further specify the type of data you would like to find in order to deliver more targeted results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An EAM system that offers a powerful search engine as an embedded feature delivers a high degree of usability. The other way to deliver a fully functional search feature is by adding complexity and cost with add-on enterprise search software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/auer02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2. Above are results of an embedded IFS Enterprise Application Search for &amp;ldquo;Wet End.&amp;rdquo; And below, are search results for work orders and tasks for a specific employee working in IFS Applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/auer03.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Locating specific bits of information in a huge EAM system is one usability task that ought to be a consideration. But making sense of large blocks of data is another. Whether you are inputting all data manually or have automatic data capture feeding information on faults directly into an EAM system, making sense of huge amounts of asset data is another usability challenge. A usability-enhanced EAM system will provide managers and executives with intelligent ways to organize and visualize asset data for decision support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tree maps are one useful tool for management by exception because they do allow, at a quick glance, separation of the critical few elements that require attention from the many elements that do not. Executives in an asset-intensive environment are often managing by exception. When assets are running within normal parameters, they do not require attention. But when operations deviate from these parameters, an executive or manager must know about and be able to quickly ascertain what corrective steps need to be taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/auer04.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. In this tree map from IFS Applications, the number of faults is represented by size and criticality by color. Users can drill down in the big red squares to find the reasons behind the problems.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img src=" http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/auer05.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5. In some cases, a manager or executive can be given much more information in a single screen, but can drill down to reveal greater detail on critical items. Here is an example of such a comprehensive screen in IFS Applications.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6. This screen within IFS Applications provides a simple and comprehensible view of production stops coded by reason.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Selecting EAM software on the basis of usability can be relatively simple if we remember our main points above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		EAM needs to offer all of the key functionality necessary to support the asset in a single, unified system. This eliminates rework, prevents users from being forced to learn multiple systems and makes it easier to add automated data capture, further reducing time spent in the system.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Web-like navigation and powerful embedded search is necessary to reduce the amount of training necessary. It is easier to recognize than it is to remember, so if users can intuitively understand how to use the EAM system based on their experiences with the Web, usability increases immensely.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>EAM market is recovering and forecasted to reach $2.3B worldwide by 2014</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The enterprise asset management (EAM) market was affected by the difficult and dynamic economic environment in 2009; however, growth is expected in 2010 with full recovery and net growth is expected in 2012.&amp;nbsp;Overall, the market is forecasted to grow from $1.76 billion in 2009 to $2.3 billion in 2014 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.6 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="right" alt="Enterprise" border="0" hspace="5" src="http://www.arcweb.com/momag/graph-eam-cr.gif" vspace="5" /&gt;Some regions will recover more quickly due to government response and macro-economic trends.&amp;nbsp;Asia, with the exception of Japan, is leading the recovery.&amp;nbsp;North America, the largest regional market, is expected to recover in 2010.&amp;nbsp;Western Europe and Japan are forecasted to experience a delayed recovery starting in late 2010 and early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;With the delay of major improvement projects do to the economy, extending the life of existing equipment becomes critical and requires good maintenance execution.&amp;nbsp;Also, with the improving economy and release of key projects, execution is more difficult with reduced resources. Both factors are driving the need for a modern EAM system,&amp;rdquo; according to &lt;a href="mailto:rrio@arcweb.com"&gt;Ralph Rio&lt;/a&gt;, research director, the principal author of ARC&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.arcweb.com/Research/Studies/Pages/eam.aspx"&gt;Enterprise Asset Management Solutions Worldwide Outlook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ERP Suppliers Continue to Penetrate EAM&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The factors contributing to growth include some that are relevant to the difficult economy and others that are applicable to the recovery. Capital improvement projects and upgrades are being delayed to conserve cash.&amp;nbsp;At the same time, managers cannot allow higher failure rates for the existing, aging equipment.&amp;nbsp; Also, there are safety issues that must be mitigated. Extending the life of existing equipment requires good maintenance execution and a modern maintenance management system.&amp;nbsp;Also, the recession put increased pressure on maintenance managers to control costs.&amp;nbsp;Many companies are scrutinizing their maintenance costs and finding their EAM solutions are inadequate.&amp;nbsp;By improving their EAM system, they do more with less resources including people, MRO spend and inventory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions in Enterprise Asset Management&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;EAM has specific key areas of functionality required by maintenance organizations.&amp;nbsp;Asset Information Management (AIM) includes the processes and technology for organizing, creating, controlling, change management, and auditing of the information related to assets and equipment.&amp;nbsp;Work Order Management includes the creation, planning, scheduling, schedule optimization, execution, documentation, and tracking of activities.&amp;nbsp; MRO Materials Management includes the procurement and management of the needed materials. Labor Management is related to needs assessment, training, certification, and scheduling of labor resources (internal employees and contractor personnel) related to the management of covered assets.&amp;nbsp;Service Contract Management includes the creation and management of contracts and service agreements.&amp;nbsp;Mobility includes the application functionality needed for a mobile work-force. It is the bi-directional exchange, processing and presentation of information for EAM functional categories previously described.&amp;nbsp; Reporting &amp;amp; Analytics includes the functionality for the analysis of an asset and asset management performance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Utilities can improve financial performance of MRO functions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Utilities &amp;ndash; electricity, natural gas, water, wastewater and telecommunications &amp;ndash; are asset-intensive. This applies for both generation/production/processing and transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D). Maintaining these assets represents a huge expense, often 15 to 20 percent of revenue, which is about equal to pre-tax profits. Why are utilities willing to spend so much on maintenance? It is simply because their operational performance requires it. This operational performance includes the ability to deliver to customers in a reliable, safe and profitable manner despite unpredictable weather events and fluctuating demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The direct correlation between high uptime and profits is obvious &amp;ndash; revenue stops when the equipment stops. For a utility, the key to a good profit-and-loss (P&amp;amp;L) statement and profitability is effective maintenance &amp;ndash; including MRO materials management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Utility Maintenance is Extraordinarily Difficult&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For power generation, each utility has assets that are co-located in a site and usually covered by a building. However, far more assets are geographically dispersed and subject to uncontrolled conditions, including weather, earthquakes and vandalism. In addition, the assets are often old &amp;ndash; installed as long as 100 years ago (particularly in the case of water distribution). Environmental conditions and the age of the infrastructure both influence maintenance requirements. Bad weather conditions often occur just when energy capacity needs are the greatest; consider natural gas for heating during a winter storm or electric power for cooling during a summer heat wave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Opportunity &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Improvement&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Sustaining operational excellence requires a strong focus on finding ways to do the job better. Maintaining financial strength, including asset performance management, has taken on greater importance in this extremely challenging economy. Managers must ferret out cost savings without compromising safety or reliability. Given the difficult task of maintaining a diverse set of widely distributed assets, most utilities must pay close attention to their inventories of spare parts and other MRO materials. MRO inventory analysis and optimization represents a rich opportunity for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several factors can result in poor inventory management for utilities:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Purchasing decisions based on minimizing risk, or &amp;ldquo;just in case&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Procurement outside the purchasing system with little governance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No vendor performance tracking (for on-time delivery and quality)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Little or no purchasing history records kept for demand analysis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Obscured visibility of inventory distributed in multiple locations&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		No adjustment for changes made to assets or operating procedures&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This lack of effective MRO inventory management ripples through the business, creating both maintenance and procurement issues and customer service problems. Also, aging inventory leads to poor turns and obsolescence with write-offs. Of course, more inventory increases warehouse space, equipment and labor for material handling. The excessive dollars tied up in inventory also has a negative effect on the balance sheet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The senior executives&amp;rsquo; metrics are in the P&amp;amp;L statement and balance sheet. Given the extent of maintenance in a utility, poor MRO inventory management has a noticeable effect on these metrics &amp;ndash; not a good thing for a maintenance manager&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Future Industry Dynamics Compound the Problem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As we move into the future, will inventory management become easier or more difficult for utilities? Several industry drivers appear to exacerbate the issue, leading to growing MRO inventory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increasing upgrades and repairs as infrastructure continues to age; includes traditional generation plants and particularly the T&amp;amp;D linear assets exposed to the weather&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Diversity of renewable and other alternative energy generation technologies &amp;ndash; wind, thermal and photovoltaic solar, fuel cell, fossil-fired co-generation, tidal and wave farm, and more &amp;ndash; drive a variety of technologies and diversity of MRO materials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Coming smart grid provides more technologies and devices to maintain&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Distributed generation leads to more dispersed, individual assets to maintain (instead of a few big items in one site, many small sites widely distributed)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Industry consolidation and mergers lead to duplication of inventory with a diversity of naming conventions at the original entities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;One Solution for Utilities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Solutions are available to aid utilities in their quest to improve the financial performance of MRO functions. One such solution is available through a company called Oniqua. This firm provides an analytical tool designed for MRO inventory, maintenance and procurement optimization. It extracts data from an enterprise resource planning (ERP), enterprise asset management (EAM) and other transactional systems (including IBM Maximo, SAP, Oracle and others). It performs the optimization, and then exports the new parameters into the ERP or EAM systems for execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oniqua Analytics Suite (OAS) focuses on the strategic aspects of MRO materials management. It supports this with a collection of software capabilities that enable organizations to make the item selection, stock levels and supplier selection decisions rationally. Oniqua&amp;rsquo;s metrics capability enables organizations to track and control the impact of these decisions. In addition, its analysis tools enable organizations to identify potential improvements with &amp;ldquo;what if&amp;rdquo; analysis before they make changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oniqua&amp;rsquo;s knowledge for MRO inventory, maintenance and procurement optimization is deeply embedded in its software solution. This distinguishes OAS from general-purpose inventory optimization solutions. The criteria used to achieve optimum availability and cost are quite different from those used in typical supply chain management or ERP inventory management solutions. Oniqua applies its 20 years of experience in supporting asset intensive organizations to fine-tune the company&amp;rsquo;s fact-based optimization approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	OAS enables users to rationalize and reduce their MRO inventories by avoiding the restocking of parts not crucial to reliability, while efficiently restocking the replacement parts that are truly critical. Based on a series of criteria defined in the project, the team will stop conducting business with poorly performing vendors and, instead, rely on high-performance vendors. The utility can consolidate purchases, optimize use of vendor-held stock and consignment arrangements, and improve the overall delivery service record levels of its equipment suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a utility&amp;rsquo;s sizable and widely distributed MRO inventory, the investment in OAS can provide significant returns. Oniqua&amp;rsquo;s experience indicates that most utilities can achieve payback in three to six months. This particularly applies to those with more than $10 million in MRO inventory, which would include nearly all medium-to-large utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	This software suite provides an opportunity to improve asset availability and materials costs &amp;ndash; dear to the maintenance manager&amp;rsquo;s role. It also provides an opportunity to improve the P&amp;amp;L statement and balance sheet &amp;ndash; dear to the maintenance manager&amp;rsquo;s career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/CVi3ybtTiRk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Emerson to modernize automation at LUKOIL refining and petrochem facilities</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Emerson Process Management, a global business of Emerson, and LUKOIL Group, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest private oil companies, have signed an agreement to modernize 13 refining and petrochemical facilities in Russia and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the agreement, which extends through 2014, Emerson will provide equipment, software, and services as part of LUKOIL&amp;rsquo;s enterprise-wide strategy to modernize process automation at their oil and gas refineries, petrochemical plants, and related facilities. LUKOIL operations to be upgraded include Stavrolen and Saratovorgsintez in Russia, Neftochim Bourgas in Bulgaria, ZAO Lukor in Ukraine, and Vars in Latvia, as well as additional facilities in Romania; in Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s Odessa; and in Russia&amp;rsquo;s Perm, the Volgograd region, and the Komi Republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Modernizing these facilities using Emerson&amp;rsquo;s advanced technologies and services will enable us to improve product quality and reduce environmental impact right away &amp;ndash; and gain a significant advantage over our competitors in the future,&amp;rdquo; said LUKOIL in a press release. &amp;ldquo;The upgraded automation is also expected to help LUKOIL improve process performance, increase production of high-quality diesel fuel, and balance refining output with oil production.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LUKOIL chose Emerson because of the two companies&amp;rsquo; successful experience in cooperating on previous projects, as well as Emerson&amp;rsquo;s technologies and full scope of design, training, installation supervision, start-up and commissioning services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our proven ability to implement comprehensive-but-easy-to-use automation solutions will enable us to help LUKOIL realize its strategic objectives,&amp;rdquo; said Steven A. Sonnenberg, president of Emerson Process Management. &amp;ldquo;We have enjoyed a strong relationship with LUKOIL for several years and look forward to helping them further improve the performance of these facilities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Unilever expands Total Productive Maintenance program with help of Informance</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Informance International, a leader in manufacturing business and enterprise manufacturing intelligence solutions, announced March 8 that Unilever, one of the world&amp;#39;s largest consumer packaged goods companies, has chosen to expand the deployment of the Informance software solution across all of its plants in the Americas. The deployment is part of Unilever&amp;#39;s Total Productive Maintenance program (TPM) aimed at enhancing manufacturing performance in efficiency and quality across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The move toward a standardized approach to drive and sustain manufacturing operations performance is the next chapter in the long-time relationship between Unilever and Informance. Unilever&amp;#39;s expansion into additional plants, including those in the ice cream business, brings to 21 the number of plants utilizing this technology and includes Informance&amp;#39;s software-as-a-service (SaaS) hosted solution. The system and software allows manufacturers to leverage real-time performance intelligence in order to assess improvement opportunities, align plant tactics with corporate strategies, and exercise the most efficient use of the information to sustain the effects of operational excellence activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Terry Herber, manager of supply chain capabilities Americas of Unilever, &amp;quot;Informance allows us to apply TPM loss elimination principles across our plants. For many years, we have used Informance in plants to tackle OEE (overall equipment effectiveness). We now have visibility of this information regardless of where you sit and can help replicate the improvement gains across multiple factories.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consumer goods manufacturers are constantly looking at improving efficiencies across their supply chains. Global manufacturers report that simple OEE tools are not adequate to drive the improvement agenda, and leading manufacturers look to solutions that deliver facts, pervasive visibility, and maximum knowledge transfer, along with real-time data to drive their efficiency and optimization plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are proud to partner with Unilever to help them achieve their performance goals,&amp;quot; said Sunil Singh, CEO of Informance. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not just about helping them advance their operational excellence initiative, but further enabling them to quantify and report the financial impact of improvements, and to contribute to financial performance through those actions that will have the greatest impact with the least investment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Informance is already a leading provider of Manufacturing Intelligence solutions, leading the market in offering Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence (EMI) Software as A Services (SaaS) subscription solutions. &amp;quot;This on-site hosted model has enormous benefits for Unilever for deploying on a regional scale,&amp;quot; said John Oskin, executive vice president of Informance. &amp;quot;Informance Advisory Services, coupled with a quick deployment model, will enable us to accelerate the impact on their operations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Unilever&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Unilever&amp;#39;s mission is to add vitality to life. They meet everyday needs for nutrition, hygiene and personal care with brands that help people feel good, look good and get more out of life. Unilever is one of the world&amp;#39;s leading suppliers of fast moving consumer goods with strong local roots in more than 100 countries across the globe. Its portfolio includes some of the world&amp;#39;s best known and most loved brands including thirteen EUR 1 billion brands and global leadership in many categories in which the company operates. The portfolio features brand icons such as Knorr, Wall&amp;#39;s, Flora, Dove, Axe/Lynx, Omo/Persil/Skip, Marmite and Pot Noodle. Unilever has around 174,000 employees in approaching 100 countries and generated annual sales of EUR 40 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Informance International&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Informance delivers Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence (EMI) solutions to help clients accelerate operational performance initiatives, drive operating strategies and capture actionable insight; measured by speed-to-value. Using Informance, manufacturing teams can drive corporate initiatives like lean, Six Sigma, TPM and other continuous improvement methods.

            <title>GM selects software solution for Chevrolet Volt battery assembly operations </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	HP Enterprise Services and Apriso on March 1 announced General Motors has selected HP to implement an Apriso solution to expand visibility into and control over battery manufacturing and supply chain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This advanced technology will help GM expand control of production and product quality at its new Chevrolet Volt battery assembly plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM selected HP to implement Apriso&amp;rsquo;s manufacturing and quality solutions as a key part of its next-generation manufacturing processes. This implementation is designed to drive continuous improvement and provide flexibility for innovation in product design changes and marketplace responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Given the new technologies and the breadth of supplier relationships that are integral components of the Chevrolet Volt, we needed a fundamentally different approach to manufacturing operations,&amp;rdquo; said Kevin Mixer, director, Quality Systems, General Motors. &amp;ldquo;With market demands shifting, technologies evolving and new production processes across a distributed manufacturing network,&amp;nbsp;partners like Apriso and HP aided us in adapting quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Now more than ever, manufacturers have a critical need for real-time quality issue notification and visualization of problems,&amp;rdquo; said Mark Collins, vice president, General Motors business, HP Enterprise Services. &amp;ldquo;With industry-leading expertise in manufacturing operations, HP can employ modular, scalable solutions to increase flexibility, making global manufacturers like GM more nimble.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	HP also has successfully implemented Apriso&amp;rsquo;s FlexNet at other GM manufacturing plants in the United States and China, with further implementations planned over the next 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our customers and partners increasingly view Apriso as a trusted advisor to improve global manufacturing operations &amp;ndash; a challenge we have consistently met,&amp;rdquo; said Jim Henderson, president and chief executive officer, Apriso. &amp;ldquo;Apriso has a deep understanding of the unique issues facing the automotive industry, which can benefit GM by incorporating the industry&amp;rsquo;s best practices for quality, continuous improvement and manufacturing operations excellence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM&amp;rsquo;s new battery production facility is located in Brownstown Township, Mich. The Chevrolet Volt plug-in electric passenger car is currently scheduled for production this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About GM &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest automakers, traces its roots back to 1908.&amp;nbsp;With its global headquarters in Detroit, GM employs 204,000 people in every major region of the world and does business in some 140 countries.&amp;nbsp;GM and its strategic partners produce cars and trucks in 34 countries, and sell and service these vehicles through the following brands:&amp;nbsp;Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, GM Daewoo, Holden, Opel, Vauxhall and Wuling.&amp;nbsp;GM&amp;rsquo;s largest national market is the United States, followed by China, Brazil, Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Italy.&amp;nbsp;GM&amp;rsquo;s OnStar subsidiary is the industry leader in vehicle safety, security and information services.&amp;nbsp;General Motors acquired operations from General Motors Corporation on July 10, 2009, and references to prior periods in this and other press materials refer to operations of the old General Motors Corporation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Researchers offer guidelines for companies considering on-demand ERP</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Plex Systems Inc., a provider of ERP software for manufacturers, announced the availability of the newly published &amp;ldquo;SaaS ERP: Trends and Observations&amp;rdquo; report by Aberdeen Group, a Harte-Hanks Company.&amp;nbsp;Plex Systems sponsored the report, which is now available as a free download &lt;a href="http://offers.plex.com/aberdeen-saas-trends.html"&gt;(click here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the report, researchers assess the status of ERP solutions delivered as a &lt;a href="http://www.plex.com/ondemand/index.asp"&gt;Software as a Service&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(SaaS), and provide guidance for companies that are considering SaaS ERP as a viable option. The paper offers a thorough comparison of SaaS versus hosted deployment models, and looks specifically at the results of those companies who have implemented on demand ERP systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Aberdeen has been watching Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) deployment models closely,&amp;rdquo; stated Cindy Jutras, vice president and group director, Aberdeen. &amp;ldquo;At the outset, we characterized ERP as the Last Bastion of Resistance to SaaS. Later we revisited the topic and found SaaS ERP had not kept pace with the hype-cycle of other SaaS enterprise applications. Now in this timely report, in spite of the surge in interest in cloud computing and virtualization and the growing adoption rates of other SaaS applications, SaaS ERP has yet to take off. We ask the question in the report whether this reluctance is justified, and under what conditions these walls of resistance come tumbling down.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This report provides valuable insight to those manufacturers evaluating ERP systems as an on demand Web service, and makes the distinction that with the true SaaS model, all users run off one version of the software with technologies that guarantee privacy and security,&amp;rdquo; noted Patrick Fetterman, vice president, Plex Systems Inc. &amp;ldquo;The approach evolved to drive out costs and complexity in the relationship between the software vendor and the manufacturer, and addresses many problems that have arisen over the decades with legacy ERP packages.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Plex Systems Inc.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Plex Systems Inc. is the developer of Plex Online, a software as a service (SaaS) solution for the manufacturing enterprise and the only solution to achieve the prestigious Champion ranking in Aberdeen Group&amp;rsquo;s 2009 &amp;ldquo;ERP in Manufacturing&amp;rdquo; AXIS report. Founded in 1995, Plex Systems is headquartered in Auburn Hills, Mich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/-C03xJwlZUg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Manufacturers go paperless to boost lean efforts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers have long endured the extra costs associated with creating, updating, managing, and recycling hard copy policy and procedure manuals. Now they&amp;rsquo;re finding another reason to banish paper from their shop floors: going paperless can give their lean initiatives a big boost.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For example, electronic procedure manuals further zero-waste goals by ensuring operators are on the same page with the latest policies and practices. What&amp;rsquo;s more, organizations can link electronic manuals to standard operating procedures stored online and even include video clips to illustrate updates and new methodologies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Electronic documents represent much more than just a shift away from paper. They allow you to add new and richer content as well,&amp;rdquo; says Karen Theel, Oracle senior director, manufacturing product strategy.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	And because electronic manuals are easy to revise from a central location there&amp;rsquo;s less danger that operators will follow obsolete procedures because they&amp;rsquo;re consulting an old manual.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The new Oracle Manufacturing Operations Center further builds on the benefits of using electronic information by collecting real-time shop-floor data that allows managers to constantly track production lines and quickly spot defects to keep waste to a minimum.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Traditional business intelligence provides reports on manufacturing process at the end of the day or week, but the Manufacturing Operations Center allows companies to look at data in real time,&amp;rdquo; Theel says. &amp;ldquo;If they see something trending out of control, they can make a change right then and there in the process.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/BW2ZXM6MrgU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ERP system helps Honest Tea to half its inventory levels</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SYSPRO USA, a leading provider of enterprise resource planning software, announced that Honest Tea reports it has slashed inventory levels by more than 50 percent thanks to the combination of astute management aided by real-time inventory data and greater forecasting accuracy from its ERP software implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to chief financial officer Jonathan Clark, SYSPRO software lets the company know how much raw materials it has on hand at any point in time as well as enabling it to more precisely forecast production levels. These elements are particularly critical, notes Clark, as Honest Tea outsources all manufacturing to co-manufacturers or co-packers, providing each with the raw materials and recipes to make the teas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honest Tea chose SYSPRO software in 2007 after an extensive software search. Clark simply states, &amp;ldquo;SYSPRO fit our needs. We&amp;rsquo;re going to be a $200 to $250 million company, and we needed software that could handle that volume. SYSPRO does have a great track record, and SYSPRO has room for growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Honest Tea&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Honest Tea, headquartered in Bethesda, Md., makes a variety of ready-to-drink bottled organic teas, thirst quenchers and drinks that are sold in tens of thousands of stores across the United States. In 2008, The Coca-Cola Company acquired a 40 percent interest in Honest Tea, and today Coca-Cola and its subsidiaries are both suppliers and customers. In 2010, Honest Tea will be expanding its relationship with Coca-Cola, whereby Coke will be manufacturing Honest organic teas in glass bottles out of its plant in Massachusetts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/W4ZMoGsyKk8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SAP delivers new templates for manufacturing execution</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SAP AG is now delivering preconfigured, best practice templates for its SAP Manufacturing Integration and Intelligence (SAP MII) application to support light weight manufacturing execution in batch manufacturing industries. The batch manufacturing with SAP MII templates are cost-free and extend the SAP MII architecture by providing prebuilt, plant and role-specific composites to support manufacturing preparation, execution, documentation and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The templates cover nine application areas: role-specific manufacturing operations cockpits, manufacturing order list, material identification, work instructions, quality control, production confirmation, shift book, monitoring and logging, and manufacturing performance. The templates are a complementary extension to the &amp;quot;Manufacturing Visibility, Intelligence and Integration&amp;quot; package, offered as part of the Best-Run Now initiative from SAP. The fast time-to-benefit is a key value driver for the Best-Run Now packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sika AG, a manufacturer of specialty chemicals for construction and industry based in Baar, Switzerland, is the forerunner to the batch manufacturing project. The company defined and implemented SAP MII composites developed by SAP partner Trebing + Himstedt with a new plant opened to increase production of its Sikaflex product. Sika AG successfully made productive use of SAP MII for manufacturing execution with functionality for order execution, while enjoying lower licenses and implementation costs in comparison to traditional manufacturing execution systems. The results of these developments and implementation formed a central part of the new templates now being delivered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The development of these templates showcases the strength of SAP MII as a highly specified infrastructure for developing plant to enterprise integration and creating powerful composites for manufacturing execution that can run decoupled from the enterprise resource planning (ERP) application SAP ERP. The pre-built templates can be used in their entirety or extended to meet additional customer requirements.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/B6UWEVTrmaM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>How to get the most out of your CMMS/EAM system</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many firms today are not leveraging the full capacity of their current computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS) or enterprise asset management (EAM) systems. Analyst studies indicate that as little as 5 to 10 percent of current CMMS/EAM capabilities are used in many cases, with medium use factored in the 20 to 30 percent level. It is the exceptional firm that exceeds 40 percent of the capability and benefits available from a fully implemented CMMS/EAM to them. But why is this the case?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This article explores the current trends taking place within CMMS/EAM with a look at both the present and future trends emerging. Many firms, quite frankly, have not kept abreast of the many features and functions available to them or have operated in an isolated world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of change&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We must first acknowledge that we are living and working in a dynamic world. Things are moving around us continuously, whether we realize it or not. It is perfectly natural to attempt to hold the world still as we write new code or add some element of functionality in the perfect operating world. Acknowledging change is the first step; having the necessary support and service systems in place to accommodate those variations is the second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Changes often take place slowly, like the introductions of steam power over sail or the railroads over the horse and wagon. It took more than 20 years for the car and truck to become commercially viable 100 years ago. Many firms continue to hang on to their &amp;ldquo;tried-and-true&amp;rdquo; manual and paper-based record systems simply because it was the way &amp;ldquo;we always do things around here.&amp;rdquo; Case in point is today&amp;rsquo;s doctor&amp;rsquo;s office, governed by stringent HIPAA regulations, or real estate closings, still requiring a mountain of paper with numerous signatures. Between 22 and 25 percent of healthcare expenses are consumed by administrative paperwork. So, we agree that as the world turns, some systems have an improved adoption over other delivery mechanisms. An example of rapid uptake may be the newest iPod, sold to every available teenager by the millions at Christmastime, with capability to download thousands of songs and a variety of videos and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;We live in an integrated world&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;As the planet gets smaller with direct connection, we can make ourselves available at any point in the world on very short notice. VOIP (voice over Internet protocol), Web conferencing and satellite technology can find us anywhere on the globe. Examples are Webinars broadcast globally and VOIP, where for nearly free, we can communicate in real-time and Webcast our intentions to a global audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Our world is now connected, more than just a few months ago. System integrators (ie: Accenture, Bearing Point, Cap Gemini, Delliotte, IBM, etc.) are earning billions of dollars connecting various software operating platforms and applications so that business leaders have better visibility into their operations. Moving information more effectively today is the new corporate challenge. Being able to move data and process it &amp;ndash; making decisions &amp;ndash; will be even more important in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Twenty years ago, moving bits and bites at 300 dpi with acoustical couplers was considered average, and the high-speed modem was 1,200 baud. Today, most firms are abandoning dial-up, and one advertiser states that they &amp;ldquo;don&amp;rsquo;t do jack&amp;rdquo;, meaning the abandonment of the wire and connector. DSL and high-speed lines continue to move data traffic at astounding speeds (300 baud vs. 100M) compared to the movements of yesteryear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using this capability, firms need to leverage integration of their applications into a collective executive decision support system often referred to as analytics or business intelligence. The challenge is how to connect the numerous niche applications to be able to operate as a unified enterprise resource planning (ERP) company-wide decision service and maintenance support process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The niche decision; was it the right one?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many large firms have a large number of stand-alone niche service and maintenance applications running. Making the niche decision, selecting best-of-breed, appeared to be the right thing to do at the moment to address a specific service need or service application. Having a human resource (HR/HCM) package, a stand-alone warehouse or inventory system, transportation module or procurement package all seemed like the right decision at the time. But times have changed. These systems now need to communicate with one another. Inventory needs to communicate with transportation and with procurement. The supply chain needs to be completed by interconnection. The cost burden for this synergy of the multiple disparate niche solutions will be a significant portion of any IT organization&amp;rsquo;s costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent estimates indicate that up to 70 percent of IT budgets are devoted to maintaining and interconnecting existing applications. So, in reality, was the niche decision a good one, hundreds of times over, as the new challenge is how to connect them together? The other alternative may be to look for systems on a common platform or already pre-connected such as from full-suite ERP providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fix it yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Surveys indicate that approximately 30 percent of service visits can be avoided by proper care of a skilled or trained operator. Industry is moving toward more highly reliable devices that require less maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When was the last time you changed the spark plugs in your car? With onboard diagnostics becoming more prevalent in products and equipment today, users have the ability to fault locate and repair many of the devices in service. Examples include office copiers or printers that run diagnostics to locate paper jams or failures. We anticipate seeing more CRUs &amp;ndash; customer replaceable units, meaning as a part fails or begins to fail, a diagnostic feature will identify the assembly and indicate to the user that the certain part needs replacement. In turn, the product sends a signal to a call center that can automatically run a diagnostic to confirm the error report, and once satisfied that the unit is in degraded mode, then mails a replacement part to the user for replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recent experiments on toner and developer or paper outages have proved successful with printers. When toner or any consumable begins to run low, even when an oil change is due on your car, a replacement package may arrive at your door one or three days prior to stock-outs &amp;ndash; a perfect example of lean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The last time I went to Costco and stocked up on toner, I found that by the time I used the last cartridge (as I needed to buy a supply of 50), the toner had solidified or petrified and the cartridge expiration date was four years earlier. So, the operation here is seamless to the user and perfect from a lean (zero stock) inventory perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Greater emphasis is being placed today on the unit operator to be sensitive to maintenance requirements. On the other hand, management is demanding what seems to be 100 percent availability. In many cases, operators detect malfunction prior to catastrophic failures, such as motors seizing due to lack of lubricant, of strange noises, vibrations, early alerts or some indicator of possible failure. It is in the best interest of the equipment that the unit be investigated immediately; however, logic dictates that if the equipment is engaged in a critical production operation, when taking the unit out of service would result in the loss of perhaps millions of dollars in production volume, then the unit is expected to continue performing despite the possible negative consequences of continued operation (such as in a low oil or overheat condition).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pay me now or pay me later&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;One of the best investments that firms can make is the expenditures on periodic service and preventive maintenance repairs on their operating equipment. Mechanical products that involve any type of movement, even fans on electrical equipment, require periodic servicing, cleaning and update to maintain the original integrity and continued reliable performance. When I travel to numerous locations in the world and take taxi cabs to various cities, I often inquire as to number of miles on the vehicle and the frequency of oil and filter changes. One cab in Houston had more than a half-million miles as the driver reported that the oil was changed religiously every 3,500 miles. Materials used today in the production of equipment are much more durable than the materials of yesterday. If properly serviced, firms can enjoy many years of productive operation from their assets if they were just properly maintained to the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s specifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Oil and filter changes along with tire rotations and the periodic 30,000-mile major services are the best investments car owners can make in retaining the original condition and higher residual value of their vehicles. Being stranded on the highway is never a pleasant experience. Failed fan belts, tires, windshield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	wiper blades or hoses are just a few examples of lower-cost items that can and should be inspected for wear and needed replacement prior to failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maintenance is a business, not just a service&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Many think of maintenance as a necessary evil, a cost center, overhead or non-productive. This is far from the truth. Maintenance operations perform a highly valuable service to maintain assets and related production equipment on the condition of its original condition and to provide reliable and economic operation. Maintenance is serious business as it works to comply with safety, health and quality regulations. Units from fire extinguishers to elevators and escalators need to have documented evidence of inspection and service to perform properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Picture yourself picking up a fire extinguisher in the time of an emergency to put out an office fire, only to realize the unit is non-operational with an expired tag from four years earlier &amp;ndash; like my example of the expired printer toner. Fortunately, we have inspection laws that require commercial and industrial work environments to be properly protected with the availability of inspected, tested and operating fire extinguishers. The existence of an inspection tag is not the absolute certainty of a functioning device, as certain very low-cost providers of fire extinguisher services are known to have delivered and installed non-working units as a scam. Of course, firms should be alerted to these scam artists at prices too good to be true because it probably is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The use of consistent-performing service firms is the best assurance for reliable performance. Shaving a few dollars in service procurement by moving to a lower-quality lubricating oil or filter is probably not the best avenue for cost reduction. Many firms take this path on a temporary basis that eventually becomes a long-term trend. The performance eventually catches up with the expenditures. Lower-quality consumables, from copier toner and developer to lubricating oils and filters for engines to pump seals, although attractive in saving money in the short run, eventually lead to asset replacement in a shorter time period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why does this matter?&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It matters because critical production may depend on it. From elevators to automatic doors for office entry, to pumps, pipes, tanks and motors in a refinery, proper service and maintenance are crucial ingredients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Having all the information available to make the best possible decision in maintenance planning is important in achieving the proper service and production goals for the operation. It would be unrealistic to attempt to run a major service organization manually, on paper, with numerous clerks, as it was done in the early days of the Industrial Revolution. With the advent of the computer and modern databases, firms now enjoy the luxury of enterprise asset management (EAM) to better control maintenance operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Advanced programs have been developed to guide firms in optimizing the maintenance approach so that performance can be maintained at a highly reliable state, approaching Six Sigma uptime (99.999 percent). Think of the complexity of jet engines mounted on a large airframe that is capable of flight. Jet engine performance at the 99.9 percent level would yield several crashes per day at failed takeoff &amp;ndash; totally unacceptable. As a result, airlines have adopted sophisticated and highly regulated maintenance procedures, coupled with inspections and certifications, to assure proper performance at or above the Six Sigma threshold (3.4 incidents per billion). For this reason, the American airline industry is experiencing one of the best records regarding airline safety and reliability. This safety and reliability model is the envy of industry. If only other operating systems were able to perform at the same level of service, such as our local cable TV provider whose service only seems to fail during playoff games in overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is significant to note that many firms are satisfied with the way things have been done in the past. Uptake on advanced maintenance has been adopted by those on the cutting edges of competition, innovation and performance in a survival market. Large firms employing thousands in a continuous production model, such as an assembly line, cannot afford to remove assets from service when millions of dollars in production value are at stake. For this reason, firms have adopted the enterprise maintenance model linking together their operating, production and utilities in a fully integrated view for consistent servicing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img height="382" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/web_exclusives/slade01.gif" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Maintenance strategies usually fall into one of several categories depending on both the value and importance of the asset. The diagram above depicts the service and maintenance strategy for firms producing products, from razor blades to locomotives. The most inexpensive products are typically never maintained and disposed of after use, called &amp;ldquo;throw-aways&amp;rdquo;. Cell phones, small TVs and VCRs now fall into this category. Some devices such as copy machines or printers are serviced by their users or operators. More advanced, skilled technicians with the proper parts repair units (e.g., washing machines and dryers) typically conduct this service. Moving up the maturity curve, complex or sophisticated devices employing numerous parts and/or of higher value may receive some type of preventive maintenance to achieve proper operation such as the example of regular oil changes for vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the real-time access of low-cost Internet or cell technology, firms can now remotely monitor the performance of their assets to assure proper operations. Unit sensors can transmit temperature or pressure settings along with critical vibration or noise parameters &amp;ndash; such as the impending failure of a bearing. Some firms go one step further to even have cameras focused on assets in the event a foreign object such as a tree limb or other foreign or falling object would interfere with operations. Also, low-cost motion detectors alert security in the event a trespasser or animal violated the perimeter zone such as in secure utility or airport operations. Bringing all of this intrusion, operating and malfunction information together into one place becomes the cornerstone for the modern maintenance EAM operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Design operations need to develop predictive models for their products. We know when razor blades fail after a few uses and we know when it is time to retire a motor once the seals have failed and replacement parts are no longer available. With assets from pumps to motors, vehicles to airplanes, manufacturers need to make available to users a typical use-model of predictive behaviors. These predictions guide operations through normal or abnormal life cycles of assets to better predict performance. Returning to the example of the taxi with 500,000 miles, if properly maintained, car engines can have a long life. Several examples of cars going more than 1 million miles have been validated. Predictive models help companies plan their future capital and maintenance horizons better. Capital expenditures can be better forecasted while units can operate with improved predictability with the availability of such valuable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The highest degree of integration is the EAM state where all of the assets are interrelated and monitored from a single system of maintenance and operations. Using an EAM in conjunction with operating systems for production allows firms to enjoy the great benefits available from reliable production. Examples include transportations firms that need to take assets out of service when on the ground &amp;ndash; as it is not possible to remove planes from service in the air, or similarly, locomotives, buses, taxis or monorails during operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Single source of truth&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Having all of the information available in real time in one place is utopia. By having this, information becomes &amp;ldquo;actionable&amp;rdquo;, meaning if a parameter should fall out of range (min/max), an alert can trigger immediate investigation and create a service order if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Technicians can review the operating condition via remote monitor and compare it with the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s predictive model. Technicians would know that by operating the asset under the new parameter, such as in elevated temperature, the asset would fall into degraded mode and either shorten the life span or operate uneconomically until the needed repair was made. Operating options would be available instead of just hard-failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EAM provides the framework for firms to adopt their best practices into operations settings to achieve better performance. However, achieving these goals is easier written than accomplished. To accomplish this end, firms need to adopt IT practices to capture data into a unified database or warehouse for processing with analytics and real-time dashboards for management visibility. Line managers need the drill-down tools to access answers to conditions without leaving their office or the control room. When all of this information comes together, assets can work in harmony with each other and maintenance management can move toward the proactive role instead of the traditional role of reactive fire fighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Conclusion&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To operate in today&amp;rsquo;s competitive world, firms need an integrated EAM system. By working in harmony, maintenance and production assets can yield greater production provided the information is made available to service management. To achieve this end, maintenance management needs to extract the critical asset information to be in a position to detect failures prior to occurrence. Manufacturers need to share with their customers the predictive behaviors of assets so that user firms can be ahead of the failure curve and take needed proactive steps to eliminate unanticipated failures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Computer and communications technologies exist today to help firms achieve this goal; acronyms such as BPEL (Business Process Extension Language) and SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) will become household words in the service and maintenance communities. With prices shrinking for data storage, communications and networks, cost should no longer be a barrier for firms to use available technology to accomplish their desired operating objectives. Tomorrow, with foreign competition growing at expanding rates, it will be the firm that fully leverages its EAM systems in the context of its enterprise information architecture that will achieve competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Infor to spark lean gains at C/G Electrodes</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Infor, a leading provider of business software for mid-market customers, has been selected by C/G Electrodes, a leading manufacturer of graphite electrodes used in the electric arc furnace steel making process, to manage its business processes and strengthen its lean manufacturing practices. Infor ERP SyteLine, a dynamic enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution for discrete manufacturers, along with its Advanced Planning and Scheduling module, will help the company optimize inventory, improve team member efficiency, and bolster customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As the only wholly American owned manufacturer of graphite electrodes, we required an ERP system with a wide range of functionality for production planning, shop floor control, and product costing,&amp;quot; said Carolyn Hockman, manager, Business Systems at C/G Electrodes. &amp;quot;We selected Infor because Infor is sharply in tune with the requirements of mid-sized manufacturers and took the time to get to know and understand our business. Throughout the process it became clear that we were important to Infor, and that ERP SyteLine was the best solution to meet our unique needs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ERP SyteLine will help C/G Electrodes meet its goal of shortening time-to-market by providing greater accuracy, detail and speed of information across the complex processes required for hybrid manufacturing. Also key to C/G Electrodes&amp;#39; selection of ERP SyteLine was the solution&amp;#39;s analytic and reporting capabilities, which quickly deliver critical information to users without disruption to daily operations. This functionality will enable primary decision makers to make the choices they need to be more competitive and enhances workforce productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Advance Planning and Scheduling module for ERP SyteLine will help the company coordinate orders with production planning to improve customer service. Due to the nature of the graphite electrode manufacturing industry, C/G Electrodes requires a planning module fully capable of synchronizing inventory and material flow to customer demand. Advanced Planning and Scheduling gives C/G Electrodes heightened visibility into inventory and available resources, improving its lean manufacturing operations and increasing customer service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>GM uses Maximo as global maintenance solution</title>
            <description>&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/images_spacer.gif" width=1 height=1&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Dave Reiber of General Motors speaks about using IBM Maximo Asset Management to make sure the company's production processes are consistent throughout the world. Using Maximo, GM is able to have a singular system by which its manufacturing processes are maintained. This system ensures that GM builds cars and trucks in the U.S. the same way they are built in Asia and Europe. The company has implemented Maximo as the main enterprise asset management solution for monitoring maintenance systems on a worldwide level, and Reiber has found that Maximo is a reliable tool that works globally. Different countries had previously used a patchwork system of different maintenance solutions, but IBM Maximo has provided a consistent global solution, fulfilling the need to improve responsiveness and proving to be a good return on investment. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>A recession tactic: Use ERP to manage maintenance contractors</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;During an economic slowdown, manufacturers tend to downsize in the front office, the plant floor and sometimes even in maintenance. While many maintenance departments already outsource some tasks, force reductions will mean more use of contractors in the months ahead.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It will not be practical for a manufacturer to outsource maintenance entirely, but many will outsource as much as they can. Unlike members of the maintenance staff, contractors are only on the clock for you when they are on site, and there are efficiencies to be realized. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Even with many modern enterprise asset management (EAM) or computerized maintenance management systems (CMMS), it can still be a challenge to optimize the work of an internal maintenance staff, much less the work of outside contractors. But there are some specific technology tools and best practices that can allow a maintenance manager to plan for and coordinate the work of outside contractors just as if you were running a unified, world-class, maintenance department. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Identifying when to outsource&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are really three different situations in which outsourcing maintenance will be attractive. Holistically, good management of contractors requires a preventive maintenance setting, and you should have the sufficient historical data on the amount and type of work required to maintain each piece of equipment so you can make projections about future needs. It only takes a small amount of equipment history, kept in an EAM application that has predictive and statistical capabilities, in order to begin to make some of these determinations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=233 alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure1.jpg" width=417&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Object Structure: The plantâs equipment is entered into the EAM Module in Object records that are organized into a structure for cost roll-up. This allows the maintenance manager to then view the cost to maintain the plantâs equipment at different points in the structure such as the overall cost of all equipment in the plant or down to an individual component.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;IMG height=242 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure2.jpg" width=436&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Equipment Object Cost/Revenue Analysis: This is the view that allows the maintenance manager to see the cost/revenue for the equipment at any level in the structure and for any period of time by the different cost types.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During downsizing, a smart manufacturer will hang on to the people whose skill sets are directly related to its specific manufacturing processes. But even in the best of times, many maintenance departments already outsource two types of tasks. The first type is maintenance of assets that are separate and distinct from the automation and production equipment itself â things like air conditioning, refrigeration, HVAC, boilers. These tasks are not immediately related to the ability of the manufacturer to get product out the door, and can easily be handled under long-term contracts. That allows you to specialize in the production equipment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Highly specialized work is often outsourced as well because it requires skills and equipment that are needed only infrequently â things like thermography inspections, laser alignment of Thompson motors or vibration analysis. But with a reduced workforce, maintenance managers will want to look carefully at their equipment histories and analyze the frequency with which certain tasks need to be performed. If it is hard to cost-justify maintaining the capability internally, contracting that function out may be a better choice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Conversely, if your maintenance schedule calls for a large amount of refit work and you are short of certified welders or people qualified and mask-fit for confined space work, youâll need to either work with your purchasing department to find a contractor or work with your human resources department to cross-train existing staff or hire additional staff.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An annual or semi-annual plant shutdown can also be a good time to outsource. Your time during that Christmas shutdown is very valuable, and youâll want to bring in as many people as possible to get the required work done in that constrained period of time. Integration between a maintenance system and production systems will help you make better decisions about the degree to which hiring contractors is desirable during that shutdown. If the required work can be completed in 14 days instead of 21 days, does the increase in production capacity merit additional contractor involvement?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In order to make good decisions about hiring contractors and manage their work once they are on-site, there are specific technology best practices that will be very attractive. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Integrate with the enterprise&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are some pretty good stand-alone maintenance and CMMS packages out there, but both internal staff and contractors can be managed more effectively when maintenance technology is integrated with software used to run the rest of the enterprise. And it can be a lot easier and more cost effective to operate a maintenance solution that is built into an enterprise suite than it is to integrate a number of point solutions. The benefit of a unified, integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) strategy as opposed to standalone solutions is that the maintenance manager has a lot more information available to him or her, and can leverage information and expertise in other departments. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It makes a lot of sense to integrate maintenance with the manufacturing schedule so you can see the uptime required of each piece of equipment out to the time fence â as far in the future as your production schedule allows. Then you can plan maintenance activities and schedule contractors accordingly. Integration between maintenance and finance will help make the strongest business case with senior management for either contracting or hiring necessary staff.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=234 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure3.jpg" width=421&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Prepare Work Order: The Object ID is entered in the resource tab of the Manufacturing Work Center and is reflected in the Work Order when it is created for the Object.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=280 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure4.jpg" width=504&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Load Per Work Center: The Planned Execution Time from the Work Order is then reflected in the Load Per Work Center View on the scheduled Start Date of the Work Order. This is basically requesting a slot in the Manufacturing Schedule to perform the maintenance on the equipment.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But the most attractive efficiencies for managing maintenance contractors come when maintenance is integrated with human resources and with purchasing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Within an enterprise-wide solution like ERP, the maintenance manager gets visibility into human resources data like staff schedules, skill sets and certifications. He or she can schedule manpower, see capabilities, view certifications and compare those capabilities with the demands of the maintenance schedule. He or she is also in a position to work more closely with the human resources department to advocate for additional skills training or additional hiring to close capabilities gaps.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=196 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure5.jpg" width=595&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Prepare Work Order Allocation â Craft: Work operations can be planned to be executed by a specific craft to which certain qualified employees would be assigned.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=213 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure6.jpg" width=471&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Resource Load Graph: The schedule assigned in HR to the employee is reflected in the Resource Load Graph by the red line. The allocated Work Order operation now also shows eight hours allocated to the resource on March 23.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Integration with the purchasing component of an enterprise application relieves the maintenance manager of purchasing responsibility. All the maintenance manager needs to do is place demand in the system through his or her work order and let those who specialize in purchasing and negotiating contracts do what they do best. Purchasing integration also helps ensure that the materials that contractors need are on hand at the right time, or that contractors are supplying materials according to their contract. Once again, demand is driven in the purchasing system directly by the work order.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=175 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure7.jpg" width=477&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Work Order Requisition: A requisition for materials or services can be entered from within the Work Order to create the demand for purchasing to buy goods and services required to perform the repair.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Leverage enterprise project functionality&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today, modern enterprise applications like ERP not only provide project management functionality, but also allow for management by project. Within the last three to four years, we have seen a trend toward managing maintenance operations in a project environment, with activities and milestones and work orders tied to those activities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG height=209 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/mail_image_ERP_Figure8.jpg" width=570&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Work Order Project Connection: The Work Order can be connected to a Project Activity from within the Work Order during the planning of the Work Order.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What this means is that while the technician reports his or her time, materials and work he or she is doing through a work order, behind the scenes, those work orders are tied to a project. That makes the coordination of those work orders very easy, giving management visibility of milestones that have been achieved as well as costs that are being incurred. In the case of a plant retrofit, or a large plant shutdown, a maintenance team can lay all of the activities involved in that large project in a project plan that can be shared with contractors. Work orders are attached to each activity and each milestone so everyone knows when their work needs to be performed, what manpower theyâll need, and what tools and materials theyâll need to execute a specific activity within a project. This helps the contractor complete their tasks according to your needs and also streamlines the management process for you.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;Open your system to your contractors&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is very desirable to give your contractors access to your internal systems. There are two reasons that this is a good idea. First of all, as you plan maintenance work for three weeks out, if your contractors have visibility of this in your system, they can be informed of the upcoming work, schedule their people and ensure that they have the right tools and materials available.&amp;nbsp; If they are seeing that rolling schedule, they can be responsive to your needs. This also reduces the amount of time necessary to manage those outside contractors by phone and e-mail. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The Web Portal Business to Business view allows the Contractor to use a customized view to access certain key records quickly.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Moreover, if the contractor can report their work activities directly into your system, you are getting real-time updates of work completed. That eliminates the delay that results when the contractor enters the data in its own system, and the data flows through reporting mechanisms within that contractor environment and back to the manufacturing maintenance team, which then has to enter that record of work back into the EAM, ERP or CMMS. That repeated entry is wasteful and increases the likelihood of mistakes. Real-time data can also allow for tighter coordination between the contractor and internal maintenance staff or with other contractors working on that asset. Moreover, that real-time data could allow for more efficient use of the asset, as in the resumption of a production schedule.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>How to get the most out of your CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Experience shows there are three key groups that must buy in on the initial selection of a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) and then the ongoing use of the system. Common to each of these groups is an understanding of their culture and the environment in which the system will be used. This is critical to CMMS success. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;1) Maintenance:&lt;/B&gt; Technicians must see the CMMS as a tool that will help them do a better job, be more efficient and improve work processes. It can't be viewed as a system management is using to "watch them" or give the perception that someone always is peering over their shoulder. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because technicians will use the CMMS daily, they will grow to depend on it. Early acceptance is important and buy-in during the initial evaluations is critical. Their CMMS will become an integral tool that they learn to rely on and trust in for helping them do their jobs to their best abilities as maintenance professionals every day. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;2) Equipment users:&lt;/B&gt; Production and engineering personnel must see the value CMMS delivers for prompt and effective maintenance. These are the resources responsible for producing product and generating output; therefore, their lines must operate at their highest levels as much as possible. Preventive maintenance must be coordinated with production and unplanned maintenance must be performed quickly so as not to impact production. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Personnel at the equipment level will be able to recognize the value of a CMMS and understand that proactive maintenance on critical equipment is essential. Having the right CMMS tool that enables maintenance pros to do this work is key. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;3) Management:&lt;/B&gt; People in management roles should view the CMMS as a means of obtaining metrics regarding maintenance deployment and equipment performance. Through reporting on work performed, planned and in process, management can improve its decision-making process. Having updated information on equipment maintenance history and relative maintenance cost enables management to control resources and costs more effectively. The right CMMS must be able to provide the data management needs for this process. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bringing these groups together during the selection and implementation planning stages will set the tone for ongoing CMMS success. Such a process will also encourage user input to help determine the type of system that is the best fit for the company. This should take into account the size of organization that will be using the CMMS, functionality required, facility type, budget and return on investment. These components will influence how an organization will achieve the desired results from a CMMS. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;IMPLEMENTATION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Software will not "implement itself." Unfortunately, many companies aren't deriving much benefit from their CMMS because the system has been poorly implemented. By taking a systematic approach to the CMMS implementation, organizations will be on a better path for success. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Database building must be planned and checked for effectiveness at predetermined steps. It is essential to have one person actively involved and in charge to ensure proper implementation. Many implementations fail because the database hasn't been built systematically; several people have entered their own data without direction as to what is needed or expected, resulting in a system that only can be used by the implementer. Proper implementation consists of building the database to match the environment (data formats, how data is recorded, manipulated and managed) and developing a systematic use of the CMMS that is consistent on a daily basis. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Training on how to use the CMMS is often a key component of implementation and provides a disciplined approach to best system usage. It also provides a means for educating multiple users across different disciplines on how to use the system for each of their areas. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Software alone won't improve how an organization handles maintenance. System users must understand how the CMMS works and how it can be trusted as a tool to improve work processes and effectiveness. Maintenance, equipment users and management all should view a CMMS as a means for controlling costs and increasing capacity. Having this mind-set is a huge step toward getting the most from a system. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>CMMS/EAM implementation: Success or failure</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;From Websterâs II dictionary:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implement &lt;/STRONG&gt;is to put into effect; carry out; to furnish with implements (implementation).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation &lt;/STRONG&gt;is the realization of an application or execution of a plan, idea, model, design,&lt;BR&gt;specification, standard, algorithm or policy.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;From the plant organizational standpoint:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Implementation &lt;/STRONG&gt;is defined as either a SUCCESS or a FAILURE.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many companies have purchased a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) with the intent that the system will be the silver bullet that solves all the maintenance problems. There are literally hundreds of information management software bundles available today that can be classified as maintenance management suites. CMMS have become more sophisticated and much more capable over the last five years, yet many CMMS users feel that their systems have failed to deliver the desired results. Is this due to a preponderance of faulty software or some other, more fundamental flaw? Why aren't these companies realizing the maintenance management improvements that they anticipated? What is causing CMMS software to fail to deliver the goods and can anything be done to alleviate the problems that seem to plague so many facility maintenance departments? This paper tells two stories: one of an implementation that failed and one that was a success.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Plant One&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For the past seven years, John has been the maintenance manager at a manufacturing plant located in the northwestern portion of the United States. The plant has been in operation for more than 20 years. A new plant manager has recently been assigned. His past experience has taught him that a CMMS/EAM system should provide him the data he and his managers require in the day to day operation of the plant.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plant manager gathered his various managers and instructed them to select and implement a software system. The management team felt this was a great idea and set out to do as instructed: âselect and implement.â&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each manager reviewed their respective schedules and determined that limited time would be available to select and implement a system. The maintenance and operations managers could find no time in their schedules, so each assigned a resource to help with the activities. The remaining managers agreed that these activities could best be accomplished by the information technology (IT) manager and her staff.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The IT manager directed one of her staff members to search the internet for a software system that would do what they needed it to do â provide data to support day to day operations. Several systems were identified and submitted to the IT manager. This information was passed to the other managers and a decision was made on which to be purchased.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The system was purchased and implementation was scheduled to begin. The selection team determined that this implementation was beyond their capabilities and expertise and should be completed by the IT staff with vendor support. After all, it is software. The resources supplied by the maintenance and production managers had no input into this implementation decision.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plant IT staff, with the help of vendor personnel, uploaded and configured the software on the site network, activated various modules, assigned users and loaded sample data. The various managers were notified of the completed activities and assumed the software system was âimplemented.â Authorized users were directed to use the system in their daily work routines.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At the end of the second month after implementation, during a weekly managers meeting, data was required by the plant manager in order to support a business decision. Analysis of system data available indicated that the data now available was no more accurate or useful then before the software system was purchased and âimplementedâ. Further evaluation determined the following:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;There was no clear understanding of what the system was to do for the organization&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;The capabilities and options available with the selected system was not fully understood&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Cost was the determining factor for the selection&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Various functions within the organization had limited or no input to the purchase and implementation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;No user training was developed or conducted&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;ALL users had complete, unrestricted access to the data in the system which contributed to inaccurate, incomplete data.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Should we consider this implementation a SUCCESS or a FAILURE?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Plant Two&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jack has been the maintenance manager at a manufacturing plant located in the southeastern portion of the United States for the past five years. Henry has been the operations manager at this plant for four years. The plant has been in operation more than 15 years. Past experience and discussions with other maintenance and operations managers has determined that a CMMS/EAM system should provide the data required in the day to day operation of the plant.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The plant manager gathered his various managers and a decision was made to select and implement a software package. With this guidance, the managers agreed to treat this as a project and use the same process (initiating, planning, executing, monitoring/controlling and closeout). The resources and effort required for this project would be made available. Jack and Henry agreed to share the responsibilities of leading the selection and implementation of a system. Each of them understood the importance of such an activity and the results it would have on the future of the plant.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each function manager within the organization reviewed their respective schedules and set aside time to participate in the activities to select and implement the software system. The managers gathered their staff to identify what requirements the system must meet or exceed. The current way that each function within the organization conducted their daily routine was mapped out (the as-is state processes). From these, what the daily routine would be in the future was developed (the future state processes).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It was determined that, at a minimum, the package must contain these capabilities: Web access for other plants within the corporation, asset identification and management, work order control, work planning, work scheduling, resource scheduling, preventive and predictive maintenance scheduling, MRO materials management, failure analysis and reporting, cost reporting, standard reporting capabilities and ad hoc reporting capabilities. Available system options should include bar-code reading and printing and RFID for assets and materials.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The IT manager directed her staff to search the Internet to gather information and capabilities of the various software systems which met the identified minimum requirements. A listing was provided to the various managers for review and the development of a list of potential candidate systems. A request for proposal (RFP) was prepared and distributed to selected system providers/vendors. The RFP contained questions to be answered that would better clarify the capabilities and options of each system. Each provider/vendor provided a demonstration of their system to plant personnel using real plant data. From these demos and review of the RFP, a system which would best meet the needs of the plant was selected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once the software system was selected and purchased, an implementation team was created. The members of this team were selected from all functions of the plant (i.e., maintenance, operations, materials, finance, human resources, engineering, IT, etc.). The purpose of this team was to ensure the system was implemented to meet the requirements of the various functions of the plant. Each team member worked with the system provider/vendor and the plant IT staff during the implementation to make certain the identified minimum system capabilities and options were implemented to meet the requirements of the organization as defined in the future state processes. System standard operating procedures (SOPs) were developed to explain proper system use. User training was developed and training was conducted according to an approved training schedule. The SOPs were used as the basis for this training.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During the first few months of operation, the system was reviewed daily to ensure that data was being entered in the agreed upon manner, work order control was effective, work planning and scheduling was being accomplished and accurate, materials management was achievable, failure analysis data was available, and reporting capabilities were being used and are providing accurate data. Any noted deficiency was identified and, where needed, corrective action taken. Refresher training was conducted weekly. One-on-one training was conducted as needed. The purpose of such activities was to ensure system integrity and accuracy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Soon after, during a weekly managerâs meeting, data was requested by the plant manager in support of asset and process upgrades requested by the maintenance and operations managers. These managers requested from other function managers support data including asset total maintenance costs (labor and materials), asset operational history, asset downtime analysis, asset/process overall equipment effectiveness (OEE), asset utilization (AU), asset spare parts lead-time and availability, and asset work order history data. Additional data was available if required.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It was quickly apparent that data required to make sound business and engineering decisions was available from the CMMS/EAM system. This discovery led to an evaluation of the process used to select and implement the software package. The following was identified:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Plant management was supportive of the activities necessary for the success of the package selection and implementation&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Function managers took responsibility for the projectâs success&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Required resources were made available&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Future state process were developed for activities performed by the various plant functions&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Minimum system capabilities required to support the future state processes were identified&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System ânice to haveâ options were identified&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A listing of system providers/vendors was created from which a âshort listâ was developed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A RFP was developed and sent to short list providers/vendors. This RFP listed the requirements, capabilities, and options to be met in order to be considered as a final candidate&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Final system selection was made after consideration and evaluation of information provided and an on-site demonstration by various system providers/vendors. This decision was made by the selection team, not by one individual.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An implementation plan was developed to ensure the system was implemented as required to support the plant activities&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;All functions within the organization were involved in the system implementation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System operational testing was conducted at various stages of the implementation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System standard operating procedures were developed&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System training materials were developed and initial user training was conducted&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System refresher training was conducted on a reoccurring basis&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the first several months after implementation, system evaluation was conducted on a daily basis&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;System deficiencies were identified and corrected as required&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How many of us can identify with Plant One? How many of us have knowingly placed ourselves in this position and supported activities such as this? How many of us can identify with Plant Two? What can we learn from the outcomes of our actions?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The selection and implementation of a CMMS/EAM system should not be taken lightly by any organization. Project definition, planning, and research must be performed early in the process. Requirements and expectations must be created. Deliverables must be clearly defined. Required resources must be identified and made available. Training must be developed and provided. Managers need to continuously evaluate project activities. Most of all, management must provide the commitment, leadership, and guidance required to make this a successful project. The benefits to be realized from a successful implementation will greatly compensate for the resources, effort, and cost requirements.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What will be your definition of a CMMS/EAM Implementation? SUCCESS or FAILURE&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>CMMS: 50 questions before computerization</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Before you venture down the road to computerization of your maintenance organization, ask yourself:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is there enough time, money and interest to involve all levels within the maintenance department and other stakeholders in the decision process to buy a computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) system? Is there support from top management to see you through the inevitable ups and downs of the entire installation process? Management support is essential. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sufficient resources for a complete installation are also essential. The resources include training dollars, time replaced on the shop floor and computer access. If necessary, can you get typing and basic computer skills training for your mechanics? Will management tolerate the initial research and keying of files by your mechanics and staffers? Can you get the budget authorization to replace the mechanicâs slot on the shop floor by overtime or by a contract worker?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After the maintenance system is in operation will mechanics and supervisors have the training, knowledge, positive attitude and access into the CMMS to investigate a problem? Is there continuing training in advanced concepts beyond âwhich key strokes to get which reportsâ type classes? Is there regular time set aside for thinking and using the system for research into problem areas? Do mechanics and supervisors have easy access to terminals or personal computers? Are these devices hardened against the shop environment?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is there organizational willpower to insure that garbage and faked data will be kept out of the system? Another way to put that is, is falsifying a work order to fill eight hours viewed as a joke or a crime? Will the data coming out of the system be commonly held by management and the workers to be accurate and useful? Are maintenance records treated as seriously as payroll or other accounting records?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does anyone (including mechanics) have the time to investigate repair history to detect repeat repairs, trends and new problems? Related to No. 3 above, do they have the training to use the system to answer the questions that they have?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can you and your staff spend enough time designing the systemâs categories to make meaningful comparisons between like machines, buildings and cost centers? This is a two-step process. The first step is to have the vendorâs trainer conduct a class in the category model of that system and how things are commonly handled. The second step is to actually fight out the categories that you want to use. It is critical to understand and wrestle the decisions that you make at the early steps in the setup of a system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you have 100 pumps, probably 20 of them create the most maintenance load. This rule of management has tremendous application in maintenance. It is called the Pareto principle. Has the Pareto principle (the 80/20 rule) been taught and used to isolate the âbad actorsâ (that is, to identify the problem machines, craftspeople or parts)? Be sure you understand how to generate these Pareto analysis or exception reports in the system you chose. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Will you have the support of a responsive data processing department (or a very responsive vendor)? You will want changes, fixes and enhancements. In fact, your ability to handle technology and sophisticated systems will improve after the first six months. Many organizations outgrow their first systems in a year or two.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the longer-range plan include CMMS integration with stores, MRP, purchasing, payroll, CAD/engineering? The trend is toward company-wide networks. Organizations want everyone discussing a problem to be working from the same data. This means linkages of the maintenance information system to the corporate information systems with all the links and hooks that that implies. Increasingly information systems are viewed as strategic advantages. Access to information makes a major difference.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;50 questions/notes to help in your CMMS search&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;What follows are questions/notes to ask yourself and vendors to help you avoid the most common pitfalls of choosing, purchasing and installing computer control and information systems.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A full-function CMMS should be able to help in many areas. Many organizations purchase systems to solve specific problems. They donât need other functions or donât consider them important at the time of purchase. The following questions/notes will help you focus your attention in the various areas. They are not in priority order.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Work orders&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;OL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system produce an easy-to-use work order that allows future conversion to bar codes, handheld terminals and other improvements to technology?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system classify all work orders by some kind of repair reason code: preventive maintenance, corrective, breakdown, management decision, etc.?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is there an easy way for a single person to screen work orders entered before authorization that work can begin? Some systems have a field that has to be checked by a supervisor or manager to release the job to the next processing step.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system print up-to-date lockout procedures on all work orders automatically? Does it have the ability to access a lockout file and incorporate the right lockout scheme (there might be only 10 variations for the whole plant)? Less desirable by still OK would be an individual lockout file for each machine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A good system can automatically cost work orders. Can the system you are examining look up the value of a part in the inventory and bring the cost across to the maintenance work order? Can it also look up the charge rate for the individual mechanic?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system provide status of all outstanding work orders? Does it allow sorts on different status codes? An example would be to print or display all work orders waiting for engineering.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it record service calls (who, what, time stamp, where, how) which can be printed in a log format?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does it allow production to find out what happened (what status) to their work request without being able to make changes?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it calculate backlog of work and display it by craft?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can both open and closed work orders be displayed or printed very easily? Keep work orders available for at least five years and preferably form birth to retirement of the equipment.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system facilitate labor scheduling with labor standards by task, ability to sort and resort the open work orders by location of work, craft, other ways?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Stock room&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Will the system facilitate big-ticket analysis by printing all parts over $500? Will it facilitate A-F analysis by printing the product of (in descending order) the unit cost times the annual usage?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the store room part of the system have part location to help the mechanic or store keeper find infrequently used parts?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system generate a parts catalog by type of part or by current vendor with yearly usage to facilitate blanket contract negotiation?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system recommend stock levels, order points, order quantities?&amp;nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;Maintenance history and reporting&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system maintain maintenance history that is detailed enough to tell what happened years later?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it provide information to track the service request/maintenance work order issue/work complete/customer satisfied cycle? Does it include elapsed time and other analysis factors?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it provide reports for budgets, staffing analysis, program evaluation, performance?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it provide information for work planning, scheduling and job assignment? Does it have the capability to store and retrieve work plans, copy old work plans and modify existing plans when new information comes in?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is it able to isolate all work done (sort, arrange, analyze, select or list) by work order, mechanic, asset, building, process, product, division, floor, room, type of equipment or asset?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does it provide the ability to easily structure ad hoc (on the spur of the moment) reports to answer questions that come up? This is called a report writer.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does it have the ability to generate equipment/asset history from birth (installation, construction or connection) to present with all major repairs and summaries of smaller repairs?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are system reports designed around Pareto principles, where the system helps identify the few important factors and helps you manage the important few vs. the trivial many?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system report on contractor vs. in-house work? Can the system track contractor work in as much detail as in-house work?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it provide reports charging back maintenance cost to department or cost center?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does it have reports with mean time between failures (MTBF) that show how often the unit has failed, how many days (or machine hours) lapsed between failures, and the duration of each repair (MTTR)?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Will the system highlight repeat repairs when a technician needs some help?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;PM system&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system allow mechanics to easily write up deficiencies found on PM inspection tours? Can the system then automatically generate and track a planned maintenance work order?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it automatically produce PM work orders on the right day, right meter reading, etc.? Can the PM system sort work orders by location to minimize travel time?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is it able to display PM work load for a future period such as a year by week or month by trade?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is it able to record short repairs done by a PM mechanic in addition to the PM and actual time spent?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system support multiple levels of PM on the same asset (such as a 30-day A level and a 180-day B level on the same asset)? Does it reset the clock if the high level is done (if you do a yearly rebuild, does the monthly PM clock get reset)? A resetting feature prevents a 30-day PM coming up a week after a rebuild. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are PMs generated by location by trade to facilitate efficient use of people and minimize travel?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system allow the input of data from predictive maintenance subsystems? This might include trending, days to alarm, baseline and comparison to previous readings.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can it highlight situations where the PM activity is more expensive than the breakdown?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are there simple reports that relate the PM hours/materials to the corrective hours/materials to the emergency hours/materials? This will show the effectiveness of the PM program. These ratios become benchmarks for improvement.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;General&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system handle three to four times more assets then you imagine having? Even medium-sized and smaller companies go on acquisition hunts. A successful small manufacturer might find itself tripling or more in size overnight.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system have a logical location system to locate assets and where work is done?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system track the warranty for components and flag warranty work to recover funds?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is it easy to use and learn for novices and quick to use for power users?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Is the system integrated or can it be integrated to purchasing, engineering, payroll/accounting, etc.?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the system easily handle a string PM such as a lube route or filter change route?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system run on standard computer hardware (not special hardware incompatible with everything else)? Is the system compatible with existing Local Area Networks (if it is a PC product)?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the system vendor have the financial strength to complete the contract (and stay in business for several years after installation)?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the vendor have software support people? Can you easily get through to a person? Is there an 800 number? Once you get through, do the people know the product? Do they know factory maintenance?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Can the vendor provide economical customization? Do they have ongoing enhancement? Are the programmers employees of the vendor or contract workers?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Does the vendor have a local installation organization?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are they experienced in management of installation projects for the the size of your facility? Do they have start-up experience with projects this size?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Are the vendorâs technical people well cross-trained (software, hardware and reality wear)? Itâs important that the installation people have experience with maintenance.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Has the vendor been in business for five or more years?&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/OL&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;U&gt;About the author:&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Joel Levitt is a leading trainer of maintenance professionals.

            <title>Coal-fired powergen lifts reliability with SAP-REWOP interface</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;A major Canadian-based power generation company had implemented the SAP PM computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). The companyâs focus was to use improved reliability and better maintenance information practices to enhance the value derived from its investment in SAP PM. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key project goals were:&lt;BR&gt;1) to help improve maintenance strategies within the maintenance department at a large (six by 400-megawatt) coal-fired plant;&lt;BR&gt;2) to bridge the gap between the SAP preventive maintenance (PM) software and the data required for high-quality reliability analysis using tools such as Weibull, Pareto, Jack-knife, EXAKT and others;&lt;BR&gt;3) to propose a knowledge model that will empower maintenance personnel; and,&lt;BR&gt;4) to exploit to its fullest information derived from experience so as to reduce costs and increase reliability.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The project originated in the frustration experienced by maintenance technicians and engineers at the lack of a fundamental and consistent maintenance information model within the work order process. Consequently, they were never certain of the information to be included when closing a work order; they were not sure what use, if any, would be made of the observations and comments they provided; and, they lacked a consistent way to express their thoughts within the structure and form of the CMMS work order.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Methodology&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The first step was to examine the SAP database to determine whether the data required for high-quality reliability analysis was available, and to then extract that essential data which contributes to the building of a reliability knowledge base. The data was then reviewed for consistency, adequacy and completeness. Corrections and adjustments were made to compensate for the lacking data, and revised procedures were recommended to ensure that the right data was collected in the right format at the right time. The final step was to apply the results to EXAKT in order to predict failure probabilities within a specified time frame.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For the data extraction process, the software product REWOP (Reliability Engineering Workbench Optimizer) was interfaced with the SAP work order module. This was a straightforward process, but to accommodate the missing data in SAP, a couple of simple fields were added. The purpose of these fields was to facilitate cross reference to the RCM database, and collect significant data related to potential failures, functional failures and suspensions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The linking of REWOP to SAP allowed the powergen to perform several key functions, such as to:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL type=disc&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;provide a hot link between CMMS and Reliability-Centered Maintenance so that the RCM failure mode data can be inserted into the work order; 
&lt;LI&gt;ensure that RCM records can be updated using the actual experience from the maintenance action (or in the absence of an RCM record, REWOP can create one); 
&lt;LI&gt;prepare a reliability knowledge base for use by the analysis tools; and, 
&lt;LI&gt;provide an automatic test of its own accuracy and responsiveness by comparing actual results to predicted results. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;EXAKT is a statistical tool which establishes the correlation between the condition variables, the working age of the unit and the cost-risk profile in order to show the risk and probability of failure before the next scheduled outage. Using proportional hazards modeling and analyses of actual events, EXAKT provides comfort to the executive that the risk and the failure probability before the end of the production run is within acceptable corporate limits (or not).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Results&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The initial results of the data analysis confirmed that the powergen was typical or many companies around the world:&lt;BR&gt;1) Source data was incomplete, missing and inconsistent; and thus, not easily analyzed.&lt;BR&gt;2) No standard procedures and guidelines existed for collecting the as-found condition of assets in a format appropriate for subsequent reliability analysis.&lt;BR&gt;3) Key data was embedded in text, and company-specific terminology was widely used; therefore, data mining techniques based on word associations was used.&lt;BR&gt;4) No maintenance information model existed on which to build an analyzable database.&lt;BR&gt;5) Therefore, no meaningful reliability analysis was able to be performed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Because of these gaps in the information practices, analytical tools could not be reliably used. It was, therefore, difficult â if not impossible â for the maintenance department to perform rigorous analyses in order to arrive at conclusive maintenance decisions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Applying the REWOP methodology, the maintenance department quickly recognized a better way of organizing its work orders for useful historical data retention and analysis. The advantages of separate work orders for each significant unique item-function-failure-cause combination became clearly apparent and formed a solid basis for their reliability-centered knowledge database.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Next, the powergen was able to perform reliability analyses, and established the clear relationship between a componentâs working age, its condition and its failure probability. This enabled them to turn the static historical work orders into a rich source of data for maintenance and reliability improvement. Applying REWOP principles, the powergen team now analyzes its maintenance data to produce usable intelligence regarding the effectiveness of current maintenance practices and policies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a further benefit, the powergen sees that these procedures reduce the clerical workload and, at the same time, will lead to improved asset performance as a result of good reliability analysis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In examining the degree of change that will be required for these improvements, the company quickly saw that the only significant requirement for the use of REWOP is that maintenance personnel (including technicians, planners, engineers and supervisors) use standard RCM terminology to record their field observations on the work order form. Resulting from this was the huge added value that at last everyone was talking the same language.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Next steps&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Based on the conclusions from this important work, this powergen is now evaluating its learnings in order to build an action plan for broader maintenance improvement. These key actions are:&lt;BR&gt;1) To introduce simple and effective documentation standards and procedures that will promote good, complete data on the work order.&lt;BR&gt;2) To fully implement the REWOP system and its methodology.&lt;BR&gt;3) To introduce RCM language in day-to-day work order documentation.&lt;BR&gt;4) To ensure quality of the growing reliability knowledge base.&lt;BR&gt;5) To adopt the use of reliability analysis tools on a broader basis.&lt;BR&gt;6) To carefully measure the results from the reliability analysis.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>CMMS solution? Look to the Web</title>
            <description>&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;A local area network (LAN) is a group of computers and associated devices that shares a common communications &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;line or wireless link. It typically shares the resources of a single processor or server within a small geographic area (for example, an office building). Usually, the server has applications and data storage that are shared in common by multiple computer &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;users. A local area network may serve as few as two or three users &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;(for example, in a home network) or as many as thousands of users. Most LANs are confined to a single building or group of buildings. However, one LAN can be connected to other LANs over any distance via telephone lines and radio waves. A system of LANs &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;connected in this way is called a wide area network (WAN). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;PC-based computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) systems became available in the early 1980s. Initially, they were DOS based and available on a single PC. They gradually progressed to LAN- and WAN-based systems commonly referred to as client server technology (CST). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;More recently, we have seen the availability of Web-based CMMS. With a Web-based system, you can access your maintenance data securely from anywhere in the world. All you need is Internet access. Simply log in through your Web browser and a full-featured application comes up for your use. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For years, organizations have put up with CMMS systems that take forever to install, crash your servers, are a pain to upgrade and require a ton of expensive hardware. There is also the challenge of multiple databases (multiple plants) and synchronizing data between locations, not to mention day-to-day maintenance and support. All of these hidden costs add up in a hurry. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Web-based CMMS model has taken off because it solves these problems. Let's review why organizations are moving to Web-based CMMS. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG alt=Applied_Reli-Figure1.jpg src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200803_Applied_Reli-Figure1.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. National Client Server Setup &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;WEB-BASED BENEFITS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Web-based CMMS system is a better choice for a number of reasons. These include: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ASP option &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Use anywhere and anytime &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lower overall costs &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Avoid project delays &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Easier upgrading &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Greater convenience &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Less potential for viruses &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Higher security &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Customer support &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Multiple facilities/plants &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reliability &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data entry &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Backup &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Bugs &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;ASP OPTION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are two options for installing a Web-based CMMS. You can install it on your own server or it can be hosted by a vendor (service provider). The second option (hosted by the vendor) is called ASP (application service provider). One of the major benefits of the ASP option is that hardware maintenance is the vendor's responsibility. It also minimizes the initial investment. The ASP option is proving to be very attractive for many organizations. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In general, Web-based technology offers much flexibility. If your server is down, you can quickly host the application with a third-party vendor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;USE ANYWHERE, ANYTIME &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Web-based CMMS allows maintenance managers and supervisors to use the program anywhere there is an Internet connection. It lets managers order parts, review work requests and generate work orders from anywhere in the world. As long as you have an Internet connection, a user ID and a password, the CMMS is available. Here are some application examples: 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Work request:&lt;/B&gt; Typically, the maintenance department receives requests from other departments. These requests can come from anywhere. They are usually delivered verbally or sent by phone or e-mail. A work order is then created by a clerical staff member. Commonly experienced problems with this setup are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Miscommunication leading to the loss of time and money &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Delays &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A certain percentage of requests are forgotten if verbally communicated &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Labor intensive (answer phones, handle paperwork, etc.) &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With a Web-based CMMS, this process is simplified. The requesters can access the system from anywhere and easily enter the information into the system. The request instantly becomes a work order. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Off-hour calls:&lt;/B&gt; It isn't uncommon to receive phone calls in the middle of the night when there are serious breakdowns. With a Web-based CMMS, you can access the system right at home, review the history of breakdowns and offer a solution to the problem within a short time. This eliminates a trip to the site (saving time and money) and minimizes downtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Managing remotely:&lt;/B&gt; If you deal with fleet vehicles (semis, trucks, etc.), with Web-based, you can perform maintenance activities and record them at the point of performance using a laptop or personal digital assistant (PDA). The information will be transferred to your CMMS instantly (real time assuming proper set-up is available). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Work assignments:&lt;/B&gt; Imagine that you are stranded out of town. You have a staff of 20 technicians. You are supposed to assign them work on Monday morning. But, you are stuck hundreds or thousands of miles away. However, you have Web-based CMMS. You check into a hotel, access the system through the hotel's wireless service and assign work orders to your technicians. You sleep well instead of feeling stressed out. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/articles_200803_AppliedReli-Figure2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Figure 1. Web-based Architecture &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;LOWER OVERALL COST &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Another advantage of Web-based CMMS is its lower overall cost. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Installation costs:&lt;/B&gt; With client server technology, you have to install CMMS on both client PCs and the server. This is labor intensive. If you use a vendor to do the installation, it could become very expensive. With Web-based, there is little if any installation (if using an ASP model). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Maintenance costs:&lt;/B&gt; With CST, maintenance costs are much higher since you have to support multiple PCs. Something can go wrong with the CMMS installed on any one of the PCs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Hardware costs:&lt;/B&gt; With CST, you may have to invest in hardware if current hardware doesn't support the CMMS requirements. With Web-based, as long as you have Internet access, you don't need to upgrade your hardware. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;IT costs:&lt;/B&gt; With the ASP option, there is no installations, no daily backups and no hardware headaches. Another issue is printer support. With CST, you need to have device drivers on each workstation. With the Web-based option, you are essentially printing off your browser. Less work for a company's information technology department means less money spent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Lower overall costs mean a better overall value. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;AVOID PROJECT DELAYS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With CST, there could be delays. You must wait for IT to install the software into each of the network computers. If the IT department is backed up with other projects, or if the IT department doesn't see maintenance as a priority, installing the CMMS might be postponed by weeks. As mentioned earlier, with Web-based, there is little if any installation. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;EASIER UPGRADING &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When using a Web-based CMMS, you can be certain that your vendor will automatically upgrade the program. This means that you will never have to receive upgrades in the mail (disk, CDs, etc.) or via e-mail and spend time installing it. With Web-based, the upgrading is an ongoing process. That is why there is very little training required. With CST, you typically receive upgrades every 12 to 18 months (plus some in the interim). Again, you must go through the process of installation and training as it is almost like having a new product. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;GREATER CONVENIENCE &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The navigation in a Web-based CMMS is based on a Web browser. Therefore, users feel comfortable as they are already familiar with common browser elements such as links, buttons, forms, etc. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;LESS VIRUS POTENTIAL &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A Web-based CMMS system has much less potential for viruses. You run the program off of a browser, so there is no local data to damage. If your disk crashes due to a virus, there is nothing to worry about. The Web-based server is automatically backing it up at all times. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;HIGHER SECURITY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Contrary to what many people might assume, there is a much higher level of security in Web-based software. With the ASP option, your service provider usually has an enterprise-class firewall to prevent unauthorized users. Additionally, when you access the system, data passes back and forth under the highest encryption available in your Internet browser. Incidentally, this is the same type of security that banks use for online transactions. Besides, Web-based technology lets you take advantage of Web security protocols and products. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another beneficial security feature is confirming data entry against predefined criteria. For example, users who forgot their password might be asked a question that only they would know. Only after answering this obscure or personal question could the employee gain access into the system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CUSTOMER SUPPORT &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With CST, it is often hard to explain the exact problem to the tech support personnel. It is very common to hear from vendor's tech support, "Well, I can't really see what's wrong. Can you send your data to me? I'll take a look at exactly what's going on and get back to you." You can easily lose seven to 10 days in this process. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With a Web-based CMMS, the provider's tech support can log right in and see exactly what you are seeing and then troubleshoot. That means faster resolution of problems, concerns or questions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;MULTIPLE FACILITIES &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Multiple facilities are much easier to handle with Web-based technology. Each facility has its own database, yet managers with specific passwords have access to other facilities' data. This is a very useful feature. For example, if one of the facilities is out of a critical part, you can see if any of the other facilities has that part in stock. Your problem can be solved in minutes. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Also, multiple locations can work on the same real-time data all the time. There is never a need to merge, synchronize or duplicate CMMS data. CMMS reports are always up to the minute, no matter where you are. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;RELIABILITY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Most Web-based service providers claim an uptime of 99 percent or better, which is probably better than most CST-based CMMS systems. This is because the service provider has an excellent IT staff and data center facility with plenty of redundancy. You get these benefits without having to pay for all of the hardware and staff yourself. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;DATA ENTRY &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With CST, data entry is always within the network. For example, you can't enter data from home or if you are out of town. If you did, there will be a problem with synchronizing the data. With Web-based, you can enter the data from anywhere in the world. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here's an application example. Typically, an organization deals with many outside contractors. These contractors perform a variety of activities including repair, preventive maintenance and inspection. It's important to keep a history of work performed by these contractors. With a Web-based system, it's possible to give limited access to your contractors so they can directly enter details of work performed into the CMMS. This eliminates duplication of work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;BACKUP &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a Web-based ASP option, data is backed up continuously. If you like your own backup besides the vendor's continuous backup, there is usually a provision for that. In fact, most organizations do their own backup, as well. This leads to another advantage of Web-based CMMS whereby data backup is done at two separate locations. So, if one location experiences a disaster, you still have a backup copy at another location. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;BUGS &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With Web-based, everyone is always using the same version. Bugs can be fixed as soon as they are discovered. There are two types of bugs. 
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first type is serious in nature and should be fixed immediately. With CST, the vendor sends a CD to all users, or fixes are sent via e-mail. Either way, the user has to go through installation, etc. Imagine finding a bug of this nature and having to go through this with hundreds or thousands of customers (that's a ton of work for the vendor). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The second type is not serious in nature; however, these bugs cause inconvenience or are annoying. With CST, you accumulate these kinds of bugs and send the fixes along with another release. Until then, the users have to put up with annoyance or inconvenience. Also, with CST, you normally fix a "pool of bugs" at one time closer to the upgrade release date. Fixing a bug in something written six months ago is much harder and involves more work. Again, with a Web-based system, you fix bugs as soon as they are discovered. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN class=subtitle3&gt;CONCLUSION &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The advantages of a Web-based CMMS system are clear. It offers better quality service at a lower overall cost. The fact that plant and maintenance managers can use Web-based CMMS from anywhere is very beneficial. This is an option that offers better service, lower overall costs and more convenience. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Coal-fired powergen improves reliability with SAP-REWOP interface</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In the search for improved physical asset management performance, a major Canadian-based power generation company sought to exploit the benefits of good reliability and maintenance information practices. Specifically, it wished to increase the value derived from the investment made in its SAP preventive maintenance system.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;By interfacing REWOP (Reliability Engineering Workbench Optimizer) with the SAP work order module, maintenance engineers and technicians can now accurately and easily analyze historical data. This, plus the adoption of a common language for potential and functional failures, is leading to greatly improved maintenance, inspection and decision-making techniques. In turn, this is resulting in increased reliability, fewer failures and reduced maintenance costs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Background and objectives&lt;EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;A major Canadian-based power generation company had implemented the SAP PM computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) system. Their focus was to use improved reliability and better maintenance information practices to enhance the value derived from their investment in SAP PM. The key project goals were:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;to help improve maintenance strategies within the maintenance department at a large (6x400 megawatt) coal-fired plant; 
&lt;LI&gt;to bridge the gap between their SAP PM software and the data required for high-quality reliability analysis using tools such as Weibull, Pareto, Jack-knife, EXAKT and others; 
&lt;LI&gt;to propose a knowledge model that will empower maintenance personnel; 
&lt;LI&gt;to exploit to its fullest, information derived from experience so as to reduce costs and increase reliability. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=336 hspace=5 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_powergen_clip_image002.jpg" width=240 align=right&gt;The project originated in the frustration experienced by technicians and engineers at the lack of a fundamental and consistent maintenance information model within the work order process. Consequently, they were never certain of the information to be included when closing a work order; they were not sure what use, if any, would be made of the observations and comments they provided; and finally, they lacked a consistent way to express their thoughts within the structure and form of the CMMS work order.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Methodology&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first step was to examine the SAP database to determine whether the data required for high-quality reliability analysis was available, and to then extract that essential data which contributes to the building of a reliability knowledge base. The data was then reviewed for consistency, adequacy and completeness. Corrections and adjustments were made to compensate for the lacking data, and revised procedures were recommended to ensure that the right data was collected in the right format at the right time. The final step was to apply the results to EXAKT in order to predict failure probabilities within a specified time frame.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;For the data extraction process, the software product REWOP (Reliability Engineering Workbench Optimizer) was interfaced with the SAP work order module. This was a straightforward process, but to accommodate the missing data in SAP, a couple of simple additional fields were added. The purpose of these fields is to facilitate cross reference to the RCM database, and collect significant data related to potential failures, functional failures and suspensions.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The linking of REWOP to SAP allowed the powergen to perform several key functions, such as to: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;provide a hot link between CMMS and Reliability-Centered Maintenance so that the RCM failure mode data can be inserted into the work order; 
&lt;LI&gt;ensure that RCM records can be updated using the actual experience from the maintenance action â or in the absence of an RCM record, REWOP can create one; 
&lt;LI&gt;prepare a reliability knowledge base for use by the analysis tools; 
&lt;LI&gt;provide an automatic test of its own accuracy and responsiveness by comparing actual results to predicted results. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;EXAKT is a statistical tool which establishes the correlation between the condition variables, the working age of the unit and the cost-risk profile in order to show the risk and probability of failure before the next scheduled outage. Using proportional hazards modelling and analyses of actual events, EXAKT provides comfort to the executive that the risk and the failure probability before the end of the production run is within acceptable corporate limits. Or not.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Results &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The initial results of the data analysis confirmed that the powergen was typical or many companies around the world:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Source data was incomplete, missing and inconsistent, and thus, not easily analyzed. 
&lt;LI&gt;No standard procedures and guidelines existed for collecting the &lt;EM&gt;as-found &lt;/EM&gt;condition of assets in a format appropriate for subsequent reliability analysis. 
&lt;LI&gt;Key data was embedded in text and company specific terminology was widely used; therefore, data mining techniques based on word associations was used. 
&lt;LI&gt;No maintenance information model existed on which to build an analyzable database â and, therefore ... 
&lt;LI&gt;No meaningful reliability analysis was able to be performed. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;IMG height=336 hspace=5 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_powergen_clip_image004.jpg" width=264 align=right&gt;Because of these gaps in the information practices, analytical tools could not be reliably used. It was, therefore, difficult â if not impossible - for the maintenance department to perform rigorous analyses in order to arrive at conclusive maintenance decisions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Applying the REWOP methodology, the maintenance department quickly recognized a better way of organizing their work orders for useful historical data retention and analysis. The advantages of separate work orders for each significant unique item-function-failure-cause combination became clearly apparent and formed a solid basis for their reliability-centered knowledge database. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt;Next, the powergen was able to perform reliability analyses and established the clear relationship between a componentâs working age, its condition and its failure probability. This enabled them to turn their static historical work orders into a rich source of data for maintenance and reliability improvement. Applying REWOP principles, the powergen team now analyzes their maintenance data to produce usable intelligence regarding the effectiveness of current maintenance practices and policies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As a further benefit, this powergen sees that these procedures reduce the clerical workload and, at the same time, will lead to improved asset performance as a result of good reliability analysis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In examining the degree of change that will be required for these improvements, the powergen quickly saw that the only significant requirement for the use of REWOP is that maintenance personnel (including technicians, planners, engineers and supervisors) use standard RCM terminology to record their field observations on the work order form. Resulting from this was the huge added value that at last everyone was talking the same language.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=center&gt;&lt;IMG height=316 src="http://media.noria.com/sites/archive_images/webexclusive_powergen_clip_image007.gif" width=270&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P align=center&gt;EXAKT Failure Probabilities Chart &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Next steps&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Based on the conclusions from this important work, this powergen is now evaluating its learnings in order to build an action plan for broader maintenance improvement. These key actions are:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;To introduce simple and effective documentation standards and procedures that will promote good, complete data on the work order. 
&lt;LI&gt;To fully implement the REWOP system and its methodology. 
&lt;LI&gt;To introduce RCM language in day-to-day work order documentation. 
&lt;LI&gt;To ensure quality of growing reliability knowledge base. 
&lt;LI&gt;To adopt the use of reliability analysis tools on a broader basis. 
&lt;LI&gt;To carefully measure the results from the reliability analysis. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;

            <title>CMMS and the operational reliability maturity continuum</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;One of the tools that we, as maintenance professionals, rely on for our day-to-day activities is the CMMS (computerized maintenance management system). You know, the good old maintenance department computer. Without aging myself too much, I recall the first time a computer was made available to me. It was located in purchasing (sound familiar) and based on COBOL language. You remember COBOL, donât you? Well, we were able to enter rudimentary work order information and track some of the information. Being technically inclined, I thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread, although sorely limited. The good news was that I did learn how to map out process flows, a great tool for later in life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;At another facility, I was introduced to a more robust system. This was IBM-based, a proprietary, system-wide program and, alas, required an information technology department for support. Here was a rude awakening, another corporate system, obtained for purchasing, payroll and billing with maintenance as an âoh-by-the-wayâ add-on. Does this sound familiar? There is a theme appearing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This program was much more robust than any previously used, but still flawed. I noticed that when operators entered a work request, they would call the same piece of equipment by different names. Not always would system information be correct. Therefore, sorting and reviewing work requests/orders was difficult. When asked to help correct these issues, say with a protected table of equipment names and systems, I couldnât wait to jump to the rescue. Unfortunately, their idea of jump, was expressed in time units quite different than mine. As for training, there was no training, it was all learn on the job.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Letâs fast forward a few years. Now as a consultant with all that experience behind me, I visited a company where an advanced CMMS was in place and all information was dutifully entered. This was in Taiwan and the plant personnel were meticulous about entering work order information. That was the good news. Having identified a problem in the field, I asked the maintenance engineers to research the CMMS for previous occurrences. After the appropriate level of open-mouthed wonderment, I discovered that no one had been trained to retrieve data. In this case, it was good information in, nothing out. As it turned out, the real purpose of the CMMS was to collect time-keeping and accounting information. Again, does this sound familiar?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As maintenance professionals, we understand the powerful value of todayâs CMMS as an enabler for work management processes. Some of my previous articles have addressed planning, prioritization, backlog management, scheduling, identification, execution, etc. All made easier with the appropriate application of a CMMS. We can use history to identify chronic problems, a work order database to identify and group-related work, capture job plans for future use, ties costs to asset registers. The list goes on. We understand this concept. Herein lies the rub, not all do! CMMS is the key to making your maintenance management system more effective. However, a CMMS alone will not solve your problems. The CMMS is not a silver bullet. Once, while visiting a potential client (plant manager) I remarked on the importance of having a well-documented process for scheduling work activities. I was told that this would no longer be an issue. His company had just purchased a brand new, Windows-driven CMMS that would solve their scheduling problems. I thanked him for his time and left. How many installations of a CMMS are based on financial requirements, with maintenance as an afterthought?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Often, we are strapped with a legacy CMMS or one of the newer versions of CMMS on the market. Whether the system is corporate-based, standalone, Windows-based or any other variation, I have the following recommendations. First of all, it has been my experience that any CMMS will work, in some manner, shape or form.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The issue is that your maintenance management system must be adjusted to ensure that field processes are closely aligned to the CMMS. In the case of a new CMMS, if you have the luxury, you might be able to specify a design that matches your existing process. If you're not so lucky, then you will have to carefully map out your process, identify all required CMMS touch points and adjust where necessary. Then, and this is most important, train, train, train. Train not only maintenance personnel, but anyone who may be involved in the process. Operators are often neglected and enter work information as they see fit. Work identification should be structured, priorities understood, etc. In some cases, EINs (equipment identification numbers) will require modification. The list goes on. A well-designed CMMS, closely linked to your work management process, will serve you well. Misalignment is a nightmare.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In closing, if you are either considering the purchase of, or have recently purchased, a CMMS, please take the time to identify the linkages with your work management process. You may have to make some revisions, but they will be well worth it. Document what youâve done, then train tirelessly. A CMMS is a valuable tool if used properly. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Quick-start enterprise asset management</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In early 2003, construction of a new Canadian facility for the manufacture of purified terephthalic acid (PTA) â a raw material used in the manufacture of polyester â was just getting started at Interquisa Canada in Montreal. Meanwhile, a small team of manufacturing and information technology professionals were planning an aggressive strategy. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After the 14-month plant construction process, the group â consisting of a few managers with the division of Spanish petrochemical leader CEPSA â would face a Herculean task. The company would need to hire staff not only to run but maintain the 15,000 pieces of equipment that would generate up to 500,000 tons of PTA each year. Since the management team was starting the operation from scratch, there was no human resources management system in place, and Montreal is a region with few employees with petrochemical industry experience. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While the plant construction process would put into place thousands of pieces of equipment that would naturally have no operational history on which to build a maintenance program, Interquisa management would have to quickly design and implement a system that would keep the new plant running 24/7. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The team charged with this responsibility included Interquisa IT manager Jean Trudeau, maintenance team leader Michel LongprÃ©,&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;and representatives of GFI Solutions, Montreal, which implemented enterprise applications from IFS Americas in the areas of distribution, finance, maintenance, human resources and manufacturing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since successfully launching operations in September 2003, Interquisa and GFI management have come to see that enterprise asset management (EAM), an essential discipline in the asset-intensive process chemical industry, is not so much about managing assets as it is about managing the people who manage those assets. In fact, it is the close integration of EAM and human resources systems that is allowing Interquisa to, with a maintenance staff of 45 and limited use of contract staff, accomplish 97 percent of all preventive maintenance work scheduled. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Head start essential &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To finance and develop the PTA plant, it took a joint venture between CEPSA and SGF Chimie, a subsidiary of SociÃ©tÃ© gÃ©nÃ©rale de financement du QuÃ©bec (SGF). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Often times when a new manufacturing facility comes online, the project design engineers are slow to get the specifications on the equipment to the maintenance and operation staff in a timely fashion â and when it does come, it can tend to be in a form that is hard to enter into an EAM system. In the case of Interquisa, however, representatives of GFI were able to work with Interquisa to migrate data supplied by engineers, contractors and manufacturers of the pumps, compressors and centrifuges into the IFS EAM system. According to GFIâs Sylvain Lavigne, who worked closely with Interquisa on their maintenance system planning and implementation, work in this area started well before the plant was operational. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe idea was to build the equipment into the system,â said Lavigne. âWe had hundreds of pumps, motors and electronic systems to incorporate within a complex architecture. This was a challenge in itself. â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In one respect, the lack of existing systems was a help rather than a hindrance. Often, maintenance practices evolve over time and might not be as effective as processes that are deliberately engineered. But implementing those engineered processes might meet with cultural resistance from employees. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOur first step was to meet with the maintenance staff, and start to define the process for maintenance,â Lavigne said. âThat took approximately two months. The next step was to take the technical information from the equipment suppliers and create the equipment in the system.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once each piece of equipment was created as a functional object in the EAM system, maintenance guidelines from the manufacturer of each piece was attached to that functional object. Leveraging as much information as possible at this point is crucial â particularly when there is no existing maintenance history to work from. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIt is critical that you get the most data possible from the various vendors,â LongprÃ© said. âOnce that data is integrated into IFS, it becomes an invaluable reference. That is definitely key. It gives you a strong foundation for the evolution of the maintenance module. â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Apart from suggested maintenance schedules, Interquisa leveraged another valuable resource to populate its EAM system with data â its people. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While one challenge facing the company as it staffed up was the regionâs small base of potential employees with petrochemical industry experience, Interquisa was able to recruit some veterans from other petrochemical companies, including Basell, Total (formerly ELF), Pioneer, Petro-Canada and Shell. Key individuals were also trained at CEPSA facilities in Spain. But one lynchpin in the success of Interquisaâs EAM system may be the fact that veterans brought years of experience in maintenance positions with other petrochemical companies, and was able to augment the suggested maintenance schedules provided by the equipment manufacturers, leveraging his own experience with similar equipment. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Managing people more than equipment &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In fact, Interquisaâs EAM success may have less to do with managing assets and more to do with managing the people who manage the assets. One key feature of the IFS EAM functionality that Interquisaâs team is exploiting is the ability to tie information on the scheduled maintenance for each asset in with information on the availability of qualified staff to perform each maintenance task. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to LongprÃ©, Interquisa had particular requirements as to how they wanted to schedule its maintenance staff. Rather than simply scheduling individuals for a task (overhauling a pump for instance), LongprÃ© said their procedure called for scheduling individuals by discipline â pipefitters, mechanics, welders, etc. Fortunately, Trudeau was able to â without modifying the IFS source code â configure the EAM system to meet LongprÃ©âs needs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe IT department customized IFS by creating virtual links to subsets of employees based on their capabilities â and that subset then links to persons within the human resources module,â LongprÃ© said. âThis is what allowed us to properly define our needs from HR, based on the work that needs to be done. Also, integrating with our human resources system allows us to see changes that impact our ability to schedule workers. Vacations, sick leaves and other absences show up in the EAM module, so our maintenance planner always has real-time information on the availability of the workforce.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe ability to get the information from the human resources system integrated with EAM was critical,â Lavigne of GFI said. âInterquisa took advantage of the flexibility to create a complex query in the system that identifies people available for a job. This is key when you have such a large facility operating with only a few dozen maintenance employees. We were able to link to HR, create schedules as required, and make sure they were able to determine the availability of skilled human resources in the maintenance module.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;During times of peak maintenance demand, such as plant shutdowns with tight deadlines, contract labor is brought in to augment Interquisaâs own team, and they are scheduled in a very similar fashion in the HR and EAM modules. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âContractors are integrated into the system,â Trudeau said. âWe give them restricted access to IFS, but they are scheduled the same way as everybody else.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Another benefit of tight integration between human resources and EAM is the ability to move employees back and forth freely from one internal unit of the company to another. According to Trudeau, for accounting purposes, the factory is split into two sections, PA for the production of terephthalic acid, and PTA, where the acid is purified. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThe flexibility of our IFS EAM and HR systems allows the planner to swap&amp;nbsp;resources from one section to another seamlessly through the maintenance module, without going through HR,â LongprÃ© said. âThis allows us to instantly modify the distribution of workers during peak periods or for emergencies.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMost of the people in maintenance with Interquisa had experience with other ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems,â Lavigne said. âThey had never seen a system that was flexible enough to swap resources back and forth and create queries this easily.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;People, time and materials &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With their EAM system in place, Interquisaâs maintenance team were focusing on automating as many of the maintenance processes as possible by proactively entering information into IFS, and taking advantage of dynamic links with purchasing. For each maintenance project that is planned, Trudeau and GFI have configured IFS to remove the parts and materials consumed by that project from inventory. And if materials necessary for a maintenance project are not immediately on hand, the maintenance planner is notified automatically in advance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âTo each of the functional objects in the system, we can attach documents for purchase orders, work orders, whatever we want,â Trudeau said. âThis means we donât have to maintain these documents as hard copy, and in an automated fashion are creating a work history for each piece of equipment. We have eliminated a lot of unnecessary paperwork, we are maintaining a central history and all our documentation related to a particular piece of equipment is stored in a single locationâ &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Interquisaâs EAM system is helping them not only track maintenance history, but to automate the planning of future maintenance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âIn our EAM system, we have the ability to save certain activities or tasks,â LongprÃ© said. âWhether these are repetitive tasks or events that happen only occasionally, we create them in the system with a feature called ID Tasks. Once we have planned and completed a series of tasks related to the maintenance of a piece of equipment, we can save the series as a template, which we can automatically upload the next time we need it. With a single mouse-click, we can schedule the appropriate personnel, tools and tasks required. This could involve a large number of individual elements, including the number of days and the number of people of each discipline. Right now, we are working on expanding our list of saved tasks.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;LongprÃ© said that building this storehouse of task-related information will help Interquisa build predictability and control into their maintenance operation. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âLetâs say that this morning I have a pump to repair,â LongprÃ© said. âAccording to the task record, I know Iâll need two mechanics, specific kinds of tools and a total of four hours of labor from each person. The task will automatically reserve the tools, the materials and parts needed from the warehouse. We need 10 different pieces to repair it. If we have all the resources on hand, we can repair the pump right now. If some pieces are missing, we know we need to order them and schedule the job when the parts are on-hand.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One important benefit of this proactive, forward-looking approach to maintenance, according to Trudeau, is that Interquisa has been able to significantly reduce their inventory of parts and materials. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Choose well, establish needs &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;LongprÃ© and Trudeau stress that EAM success requires careful planning. One challenge is to develop an early understanding of your needs. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWhat is really important is to establish your needs at the outset,â LongrÃ© said. âThis is how you build an efficient system that responds effectively to operational requirements.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Trudeau, Interquisa parent CEPSA uses enterprise applications from SAP, but the desire for flexibility was a significant enough factor for the team to consider an alternative, primarily because of the importance to tightly integrate multiple operational modules such as HR, purchasing and inventory with EAM functionality. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A knowledgeable and inclusive project planning and implementation team was also a factor in Interquisaâs EAM success, according to Trudeau. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âBefore our plant became operational, our core group of employees numbered about150,â Trudeau said. âOf that, we had an initial implementation team of 15 to 20. We had about two people from finance, two people from human resources, six to eight from maintenance, two people from environmental compliance and three people from IT. With that group, it took us about three to four months to design our business processes. There were a lot of decisions to be made, with a small team of managers to make them. We wanted to make sure we made the right choices and build a system that ensured we could meet all our operational needs and be successful. We are a young company that is still evolving. But we believe we reached that goal.â &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>CMMS system helps Mammoth plant make massive strides</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Using MicroMain's software as part of its maintenance excellence practice, Mammoth, a leader in manufacturing excellence, has reduced overall maintenance costs by 52 percent. And that's just the beginning.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An industry leader in custom heating, ventilation and air conditioning equipment (HVAC), Mammoth has embraced many technological changes since opening its doors as the Brown Sheet Iron and Steel Company in 1935. Innovation in the form of MicroMainâs computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) system was implemented in 2000, as part of the companyâs new maintenance excellence program. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âFacility maintenance costs decreased by 52 percent,â says Jeff Nevenhoven, technical support manager at Mammothâs headquarters in Chaska, Minn. âOvertime is down by 48 percent, and more work is getting done with 42 percent less manpower. Overall, our emergency responses have decreased greatly. This is a direct result of an increased focus on corrective and preventive maintenance work. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âThese achievements were accomplished with the help of MicroMainâs software, which is a very important part of our maintenance excellence practice. Before we had MicroMainâs software, we lacked a lot of the information necessary to make informed decisions. Now we input the data, develop reports and track our trends so that we can make better decisions.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Prior to using MicroMain, Mammoth used a manual system for maintaining its facility and equipment, with an emphasis on responding to down equipment. That was quite a challenge considering maintenance is responsible for Mammothâs multi-million-dollar sheet metal equipment, paint booths, welding machinery, overhead cranes and water test tanks in addition to the entire facility, grounds and support systems. With the CMMS, maintenance technicians and a planner/scheduler are now able to easily schedule preventative maintenance and focus on preventing problems rather than resolving them. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âOne of our main goals is to increase capacity, which means that we need to eliminate non-value-added activity,â Nevenhoven says. âWe used to spend a lot of time chasing down parts, manuals and other items, but now we have everything we need on a work order. That has saved us a lot of time and we are much more efficient in getting technicians from one job site to the next. This has allowed us to increase the capacity we can provide to the plant.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Nevenhoven, the CMMS also helped streamline Mammoth's daily maintenance process. Each day, new work orders come in, get processed and get closed out. In addition to tracking people, parts, machines, preventive maintenance tasks and inspections, the computerized system provides a daily procedure that enables work to get done efficiently and effectively.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Nevenhoven first implemented MicroMain's software in the sheet metal department, which was a top maintenance priority. Following a successful pilot project, which included about 12 assets, the CMMS was rolled out to the rest of the plant and grounds, which includes nearly 800 assets. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âWe hit our multimillion-dollar sheet metal system with it up front and it paid off tremendously,â Nevenhoven says. âWe immediately realized that we were getting our work orders out on time, completing our preventive maintenance and corrective work promptly and reducing our problem areas and emergency work.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although Mammothâs maintenance staff didnât have much exposure to computer systems, the transition to CMMS has been quite painless. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;âMicroMainâs trainer did an excellent job helping train all of the users here at Mammoth,â Nevenhoven says. âIn fact, our lead technician was able to complete the training via a conference call and a lap top computer. He had no computer experience at all, but the trainer was able to familiarize him with the software quite easily.â &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mammoth is currently using MS2000 and msREQUEST, MicroMainâs network-based work request module, and has recently purchased msMOBILE, the module for PDA-based work orders and inspections. &lt;/P&gt;âWhen we began looking at CMMS vendors, we saw that many of the systems available were very expensive,â Nevenhoven says. âWith MicroMain, we are getting everything that the competition offers and more, for a fraction of the cost.â&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/-605IkOvPRM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The next generation of overall equipment efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;When I first got involved in the enterprise applications market in the early 1980s, no one was trying to measure overall equipment efficiency (OEE) â or even talking about it. Most companies in asset-intensive industries had only their homemade maintenance management applications running on mainframe computers. But over the years, as competitive pressures increased and manufacturers started looking for ways to improve the cost-effectiveness of their operations, smart managers realized that maintenance is not a standalone activity. It is a function that must be integrated tightly with production, business performance and other elements of the enterprise to reduce costs, and maximize productivity and quality.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When IFS and other enterprise application vendors started offering standardized enterprise asset management (EAM) and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) tools, end-users approached these tools as strictly maintenance-focused. But after running these maintenance management systems for a period of time, they naturally found new ways to improve maintenance and operations, and learned to benchmark things so they could optimize maintenance activities by performing various functions at the right time and in the right way. As this maintenance data was collected and analyzed, the correlations between maintenance and other parts of the manufacturing organization became apparent.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In time, EAM system users learned that, to optimize their maintenance and operations activities, they also needed to optimize the design of their plants. It became necessary to integrate systems for design and engineering with EAM. In the years that followed, the dynamic connections between production, maintenance and engineering became clear. By the beginning of this century, many manufacturing and maintenance professionals had a fundamental idea of what needs to be done to improve the effectiveness of the overall operation through an aggressive OEE program. But even today, few companies have implemented a thorough OEE system. In many cases, equipment operation information, maintenance records and business performance data are still in separate data silos and cannot be integrated. In other cases, the silos have been partially eliminated, but processes and interfaces have not been implemented to enable collaboration and effective data sharing between manufacturing operations, maintenance and financial management.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Tighter integration for greater profitability &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The need for ERP/OEE integration is driven by that fact that, in asset-intensive industries, the importance of capturing real-time information cannot be underestimated. Although at one time there were walls between automation information and EAM systems, these worlds are now melding together. Greater integration became possible with the introduction of OPC, a communication standard based on Microsoftâs OLE COM and DCOM technologies. OPC defines standard objects and protocols for use in process control and manufacturing automation applications. These protocols enable enterprise resource planning (ERP) providers to provide integration points between their enterprise-wide systems and plant-floor automation technologies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;OPC lets automation tools from major providers such as ABB, Siemens and Rockwell Automation communicate with other systems using a standard language. It is now much easier to tie in with other systemsâ information about how equipment is operating, at what speeds it is operating, when stops and faults occur, and the dynamic factors that lead to stoppages and slowdowns.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although the technological walls have been broken between automation, operations and maintenance, business practices that would enable companies to truly benefit from this newfound freedom have been slow to change. By working with leading-edge companies, I have personally seen how forward-thinking manufacturing and maintenance professionals can work more closely together not only to maximize uptime and productivity in their organizations but also to increase customer satisfaction and boost profitability.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Challenges of implementing OEE &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The main challenge in launching an effective OEE program is that OEE tools and processes must encompass many different roles and disciplines in the company. The program must hold up to daily use by the production line operator, allow for analysis and follow-up by manufacturing professionals and management, support maintenance technicians and design engineers, and fulfill many other functions throughout the plant.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the past, plant-floor-oriented OEE systems united multiple equipment databases and provided a good interface that allowed operators to view data on the operation of automated components and equipment, but they were still missing the integration to the EAM or ERP world. Other OEE products offered OEE as an add-on to the maintenance management application, but did not capture any of the data and business intelligence contained in real-time equipment operations records.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Real-time information for improved decision-making &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Think of things for a moment from the standpoint of a production line operator. Imagine coming in for the start of your shift after being home over a long three-day weekend. You need to quickly get an update of what has happened in your absence. Have there been specific problems that might reoccur? You might find records from the previous shift in a logbook or in hand-scrawled notes. But these notes can provide only a limited amount of data and, by their very nature, cannot capture the insights of those staffing the plant in the operatorâs absence. When data on equipment operation is collected automatically and refined by the operator, the quality and quantity of data â and the ability to view it in ways that are meaningful â are greatly increased.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In researching maximum OEE functionality, IFS found that, after switching from manual to electronic event recording, the number of stoppages, slowdowns and other events recorded for two production lines increased from 5,000 events per year to 300,000 events per year. Equipment slowdowns, in particular, can be subtle and often can be detected and interpreted only by digital real-time information capture.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The fact that this volume of information contains valuable business intelligence is undeniable. But organizing this massive quantity of information in a way that makes sense and suggests changes in the decisions operators and managers make is one challenge that must be surmounted. The results of human/computer interaction (HCI) research suggest that visualization tools are essential for manipulating and interpreting large quantities of data. Timelines and tree maps are especially effective in allowing plant operators to distill usable information from hundreds of thousands of operational metrics.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Once we discard the printed logbook in favor of information captured digitally in real time, the operator need not see only the notes of the previous shift â or even the shift before that. An entire data history is available in a format that allows for easy access and interpretation to optimize the shift. The ability to evaluate data over a longer period is essential if OEE is to improve over time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An operator might look at a month of OEE data and find that quality dipped significantly â or unplanned stoppages increased â when equipment was operating near maximum capacity. Based on this data, the operator could find that it actually makes sense to reduce speed to optimize the output. Data will sometimes reveal that reducing production speed prevents breakdowns and unplanned stops, and sometimes positively affects the quality of the end product. But establishing the optimal combination of speed, quality and uptime requires excellent data analysis tools that the equipment operator can easily use. This information is also available to people working on continuous improvement initiatives in other parts of the organization, presenting an even greater opportunity for increasing profitability.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Putting it all together &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although the technological barriers between maintenance, manufacturing and business performance systems have fallen, these barriers, in practice, often still exist. But many organizations have taken the first steps toward collaboration between operation and maintenance. Their EAM applications are used by production to issue work orders, fault reports and technical data about the equipment. For example, when a pump breaks down, OEE notifies maintenance automatically. Later, the EAM system tracks the maintenance departmentâs progress toward completing the work order. Fault report data is reviewed to spot trends pointing to the need for preventive maintenance. When operations personnel take an active part in the execution of the EAM system, an easy-to-use interface, well integrated into the ordinary process portals on the shop floor, is extremely important.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The ideal OEE application also enables financial and business management to pull essential data from the ERP system, marry it to data in the OEE system, and make the information available to the rest of the organization. Management can analyze how maintenance, manufacturing operations, personnel activities, raw materials and other factors contribute not only to OEE but also to productivity and profitability. This data can be used to drive decision-making throughout the organization on either an ongoing or a case-by-case basis.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here is an example of how ERP/OEE integration can be used on a case-by-case basis: Letâs say your company is operating a test run for a new customer, and quality is a priority. Perhaps additional maintenance can be performed before the run, or speed on the run can be reduced to improve the consistency of the end product.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;On an ongoing basis, an integrated ERP/OEE system can play an important part in getting information from different management levels for use in production and maintenance decision-making. Total OEE, production throughput and end quality are only some of the criteria used in production decision making in an optimized manufacturing organization. Data from a workforce management system can be used to track patterns of productivity given the experience level, training and capacity of the staff on each shift. Supply chain management data can track how raw materials from different suppliers contribute to OEE, for example, whether a particular material results in a higher frequency of unplanned stoppages, slower equipment speed or higher scrap rates.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Data for these analyses can come from finance, maintenance, manufacturing, supply chain management, workforce management or customer relationship management systems. All of it must be linked to determine whether the number of faults, stops and slowdowns is being influenced by the people operating the equipment, the maintenance program that supports the equipment, the design of the plant or equipment, the materials being run through the equipment, or other factors.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Conversely, management needs to understand the inner workings of the manufacturing operation and maintenance to budget intelligently for maintenance and capital equipment â and to plan appropriate staffing levels, training and production forecasting.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the next few years, I predict that more and more manufacturers will close the gap between ERP and OEE. The technology is already available to do this, but more manufacturing professionals need to be made aware of the importance and underlying potential presented by this fusion of departmental information.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;OEE, the next generation &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, the next level of OEE operations is already in the offing. At IFS, we are working with several major manufacturers in workshops to determine how OEE can be transcended. As even more information about customers, quality and the supply chain is married to OEE data, we are finding that plant operators, at some point, may be able to allow OEE to take a back seat to profitability. For example, letâs say that a company has used its OEE data to schedule maintenance. However, a transcontinental ship is waiting for the next run of goods to come off the production line, and the manufacturer has been given a financial incentive to make the goods available on time. In this instance, it might make sense to delay the planned maintenance long enough to execute the production run in time for shipment.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Today, various shifts in a manufacturing facility can track their uptime and productivity, and engage in healthy competition as they track these metrics. As technology evolves, manufacturing shift leaders can track their financial returns and compete on the basis of profitability. The priority today is maximizing OEE, and using all the tools and capabilities offered by modern ERP systems. The priority tomorrow will be using OEE and ERP together to maximize profitability.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Maintenance systems: A case for data scrubbing</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;Often, maintenance systems donât reap the benefits that they promise through no fault of their own. How can you expect a system to improve underlying data? The answer is that you canât. What you need is to have good data in the system so that it can be accessed, processed and used to provide practical information for the organization. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let me illustrate the cost of not having good data with an example. A multi-site manufacturer has four locations, three of which are in fairly close proximity to each other. Each site has its own autonomous storeroom with inventory parts. At each site, there is a part-time catalog manager responsible for all database activity. Because the plant is unionized and positions often change, the catalog manager may be replaced every few months. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The resulting inventory catalogs reflect this: inconsistent manufacturer naming; missing manufacturer part numbers; inconsistent use of symbols/abbreviations; spelling mistakes; incomplete descriptions; and, duplicate items. System word searches are next to impossible and finding a part is a frustrating, challenging, usually unsuccessful experience. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance workers at all locations had long lost faith in stores; each kept a stash of parts hidden somewhere for his or her own use. To plan for a repair job, they would attempt to find parts through the system, but if unable to locate what they needed, they would abandon the search and just order the part directly; in the case of an emergency, they might call another location to request the loan of a part. Inventory value across the company topped $80 million. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recognizing that something had to be done, the company attempted to undertake the data cleaning themselves. They established a team of 19 internal people comprised of maintenance workers (electrical, mechanical, instrumentation and pipe fitters) from all four sites as well as two support people and one inventory specialist. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;After more than a year of effort, and with only half the database cleaned, they decided to engage outside data cleaning experts to revitalize the effort. Systematically, the data from each site was cleaned. In conjunction with maintenance workers from all sites, a common layout for item descriptions with acceptable noun/modifier pairs was developed; the order of attributes was negotiated to satisfy all locations; terminology, symbols, abbreviations and industry nomenclature were agreed upon. It took six months to rework the entire database. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Having good data brings with it measurable rewards. Duplicates within sites were revealed to be in the 10 percent range. Common items across sites were identified in the 25 percent range. Merging the three regional stores into a central warehouse reduced overall stocking levels and allowed sites to share common critical spares. It also freed up millions in cash savings. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Item searches successfully revealed part information that maintenance workers could count on. As confidence in the central stores grew, additional stock from private caches was repatriated, further adding to the savings realized. Overall, across the company, inventory was reduced by more than 20 percent. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The data cleansing effort clearly paid for itself several times over. It also became the impetus for other corporate initiatives. The company went on to improve its item-equipment links to further enhance the maintenance system. In addition, it consolidated items along product lines and reduced its supplier base for volume discounts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Clearly, good data yields good results. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Software market for lean, Six Sigma to nearly double </title>
            <description>&lt;DIV class=ms-WPBody&gt;The market for Continuous Improvement (CI) systems had total hardware, software and services revenues of more than $200 million in 2005.&amp;nbsp;Research from ARC Advisory Group shows that figure will nearly double by the end of 2010.&amp;nbsp;Driven in large part by strong competitive pressures and successes with CI solutions, the CI market will see a strong compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.7 percent. &lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=ms-WPBody&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;IMG alt="Continuous Improvement Systems Worldwide Market" hspace=5 src="http://www.arcweb.com/MoMag/graph-conimprvmt-cr.gif" align=right vspace=3 border=0&gt;Globalization is exerting extraordinary pressure on manufacturers, causing most to adopt Continuous Improvement programs.&amp;nbsp;The primary CI programs are Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma.&amp;nbsp;Many also use Total Quality Management (TQM) and Theory of Constraints (TOC).&amp;nbsp; âA corporationâs business processes are embedded in their software systems.&amp;nbsp;As they adopt Lean Manufacturing and Six Sigma, they increasingly need systems tailored to these programs,â according to Research Director &lt;A href="mailto:rrio@arcweb.com"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Ralph Rio&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;, the principal author of ARCâs â&lt;A href="http://www.arcweb.com/C3/Research/Lists/StudyList/DispForm.aspx?ID=67"&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=#0000ff&gt;Continuous Improvement Systems Worldwide Outlook&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/A&gt;â.&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=ms-WPBody&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Tipping Point&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;The market for CI systems is diverse in terms of the quantity of suppliers and the breath of improvement methodologies that they support.&amp;nbsp;ARCâs survey of manufacturers shows that 80 percent of them have adopted a Continuous Improvement program.&amp;nbsp;Many of these manufacturers have gained the experience they need and are ready to augment their programs with CI systems.&amp;nbsp;The market has recently experienced an increase in growth that ARC has forecasted to continue for at least the next five years.&amp;nbsp;This is a critical time for the market suppliers as CI systems have clearly passed through the tipping point of acceptance.&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=ms-WPBody&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Technology Enhances CI&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;CI programs increase business performance by involving a broad range of people, methods and technologies.&amp;nbsp;Over time, a series of small improvements cumulate and compound into a huge improvement.&amp;nbsp;Each program provides a focus and repeatable methodology for implementing a large number of these incremental improvements.&lt;/DIV&gt;
&lt;DIV class=ms-WPBody&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many manufacturers are using technology to enhance their programâs effectiveness.

            <title>Does lubrication belong in the CMMS? </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Most, if not all, companies use computerized maintenance management software (CMMS) systems to oversee their maintenance activities. From home-grown systems to complete enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, leveraging technology allows companies to more efficiently and effectively manage their maintenance, repair and operations activities. So as a core maintenance function, surely routine, lubrication-related preventive and predictive activities such as regreasing motor bearings, taking oil samples, and executing oil top-offs and inspections belong in the CMMS system like any other maintenance task, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While at a strategic level this may indeed appear to the correct approach, such decisions can and often do present more problems than they solve. Take, for example, the simple act of planning and scheduling routine work. Unlike some maintenance tasks, lubrication occurs at the lube point level (e.g. drive-end bearing), rather than the component level (e.g. gearbox) or train level (e.g. conveyor system). Yet very few CMMS users elect, with good reason, to define their machine hierarchy to such a level of granularity. The reasons are many and varied, but the most obvious is the sheer number of lubrication tasks which need to be planned and scheduled, resulting in a proliferation of the number of work orders which must be raised, scheduled and closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, consider a medium-sized plant with 1,000 machine trains. Now let&amp;#39;s assume that each train is fairly simple (e.g. the motor is directly coupled to a pump) and count the number of lube points. The total is three to five depending on the design of the system: a drive and non-drive bearing for the motor; the coupling (assuming it&amp;#39;s lubricated); and drive and non-drive bearings for the pump, which may or may not be lubricated together (e.g. wet sump bath-lubricated system vs. individually greased bearings). Assuming an average of four lube points, and just one task (e.g. regrease bearings) performed on each point every six months, we are faced with issuing eight work orders per train per year, or 8,000 work orders per year. Now consider a &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; plant with more complex machine trains with more lube points requiring more PM tasks, and the total number of lubrication PMs per year can amount to tens and often hundreds of thousands of work orders per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CMMS system designers and users are aware of these problems, so most planning and scheduling modules allow for the assimilation of common tasks into groups - often referred to as lube routes, which may contain several hundred discrete tasks. Under this scenario, one work order can be issued for the route (e.g. six-month regreasing of motor bearings), greatly simplifying the tasks of planning and scheduling. But this in itself can create further problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For instance, consider trying to track PM compliance. By combining lubrication tasks into one macro-task (lube route) associated with one work order, users are often forced with a difficult decision. They may be unable to complete just a single task on the route, perhaps with good reason (e.g. the machine was running and inaccessible, or conversely, wasn&amp;#39;t running but should be in order to perform the task properly). Should they leave the work order open, perhaps for weeks or months until they can complete the task, and achieve zero percent PM compliance for those tasks that have, in fact, been completed? Or, do they close the work order and get 100 percent, even though some activities remain open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Though neither approach is correct, the most common is for the work order to be closed, virtually guaranteeing that the &amp;quot;missed&amp;quot; tasks will not get done until the next scheduled interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even if all tasks are completed each time on every route, how likely is it that every single task will remain the same, and that the periodicity of the task will remain the same in perpetuity? For the &amp;quot;real&amp;quot; plant, work planning and scheduling needs to have a dynamic component, whether it be a planner actually evaluating work plans and modifying them to make the most efficient routes or utilizing a software-driven tool capable of dynamically adjusting workloads and task urgency. Under this model, work gets moved around to best fit the available time and resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, by defining macro-tasks or lube routes, it may become necessary to rewrite work orders and move tasks around to account for changes in lubrication schedules, or to accommodate emerging or ad hoc tasks such as an on-condition oil change or unscheduled offline filtration event. Even worse, lubrication tasks are often unknowingly duplicated, resulting in a proliferation of unnecessary and sometimes harmful events, while others are missed altogether, as the shear number of tasks which need to be performed swamp the overworked, understaffed planning department. A recent Hartford Steam Boiler study estimated that up to 50 percent of all PM tasks are unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For many reasons, a strong argument can be made to exclude basic lubrication PMs from the CMMS system. After all, what is the true motivation for including this work there in the first place? It&amp;#39;s surely not to add complexity and administrative overhead to planning and scheduling maintenance work. Rather, it&amp;#39;s to insure that pertinent data (such as accruing time spent lubricating specific areas of the plant) or asset classes can be applied to the correct cost center (maintenance accounting), and to track global metrics such as PM compliance (maintenance management).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, with a well-developed system to capture and enter this type of data back into the CMMS, you are probably better served with a dedicated system, administered and managed by the lube team, and designed to handle the day-to-day minutia of lubrication. Leave the excellent planning, scheduling and work order management tools built into modern CMMS systems to do what they do best: handle major maintenance activities and serve as a repository of macroscopic management data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/K11KGaEKhdA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>IBM completes acquisition of MRO Software</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;IBM on October 5 announced it had completed its acquisition of MRO Software, Inc., a publicly held company based in &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Bedford&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Mass.&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;IBM announced a definitive agreement to acquire MRO on August 3. MRO's operations will be integrated into IBM's &lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Tivoli&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:City&gt; software business. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;MRO's asset and service management software and consulting services are used by many of the world's top companies to effectively manage how they buy, maintain and retire assets â such as production equipment, facilities, transportation and information technology hardware and software â in a wide variety of industries including utilities, manufacturing, energy, pharmaceutical and telecommunications. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This acquisition builds upon IBM's strategy to leverage business consulting, IT services and software to develop repeatable tools that help clients optimize and transform their businesses. It brings together the best of enterprise asset management, IBM service management and IT asset management that can be used by clients across multiple industries. This enables IBM to provide software and services that manage multiple assets on a single technology platform, which addresses the growing convergence of business and IT assets in enterprises today.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>Why the controversy over ROI from ERP?</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;In other columns that I have provided to &lt;EM&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/EM&gt;, I have emphasized what should be done to make enterprise resource planning (ERP) a good investment. It is very common, however, for companies to take a big leap of faith with ERP and supply chain management systems. And, unfortunately, more than 90 percent of the companies that have implemented ERP have not had a truly successful implementation the first time around.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Despite the recent rash of articles about the limited returns from ERP, however, the return on investment (ROI) potential is there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The caveats are: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ ERP must be driven by the right strategic and tactical process improvement objectives, with documented assumptions and valid ROI expectations and metrics.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ The new processes and ERP must be implemented correctly and quickly to meet ROI expectations and become positively measurable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These two points may seem obvious, but ERP and supply chain management are rarely approached in this manner the first time. As a result, many problems arise during and, worse, after implementation. This usually necessitates a re-implementation effort or at least a major tune-up.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unarguably, ROI comes from process improvements ERP supports, not from new ERP software. Whatâs the difference? ERP software alone, no matter how good it is, makes little impact on improving business performance. If you continue to follow the same pre-ERP business processes after implementation, you can expect the same or possibly worse performance. ERP software can, however, enable and support many new processes, but not without the organization deciding what those processes are and accepting their use.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Whatâs been happening? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;With the implementation success rate so low and positive ROI often non-existent, many now think that ERP systems are expensive, wasteful exercises. There are companies that have ignored ERP and pursued a non-ERP strategy, and that have focused exclusively on cutting inventories, cycle times, costs, etc., through the application of demand-based flow manufacturing. Eventually, the organization begins to learn ERP can serve many valid and necessary purposes such as storing product definition data, processing sales orders, planning material needs, paying and issuing invoices, etc. The list goes on, but the point is that ERP and flow are not mutually exclusive.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I have long advocated reducing cycle time and using flow production techniques. Cycle time reduction and flow are not solely about changing production processes, however. What many companies overlook is that information must flow before material starts to flow effectively and quickly. If the information system is full of queues and/or bad data, and they often are, then cycle times will be longer. Also, it is true that some traditional ERP scheduling logic is ill-suited to flow manufacturing and supply chain management, but other aspects of ERP are quite supportive.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;ERP implementations have been plagued by a long list of other afflictions. The following are some common problems:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ ERP software was installed to mirror a set of existing, inadequate business processes.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ The high expense of fixing legacy systems for Y2K was the predominant driving force to replace old systems with new ERP software.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Organizations were painfully ill-prepared to conform to best practice process templates chosen by the ERP systems integrator.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Management did not answer the question, âHow do we want to run our business and why?â and therefore, maximizing performance through significant business process improvement did not occur.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Implementations were often done by inexperienced consultants/system integration personnel with limited understanding of how a manufacturing enterprise could and should run.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Pre-implementation preparation activities were not understood and done.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Executive sponsorship and active, on-going involvement with the ERP implementation were lacking and, as a result, lots of political bickering and barriers to success surfaced and ultimately became more and more difficult to overcome.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ IT personnel were all caught up in beauty contests of technical wizardry and, as a result, their concentration was not totally focused on helping the business to become a higher-performing company in meaningful terms.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ IT personnel were subjected to the slam and cram of new technology without having the time and training to transition from the old legacy system technology to the new.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;The ERP ROI debate &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most new ERP system implementations have been disappointing, and have needed significant cleaning up to achieve positive ROI. Many ERP implementation failures were caused, at least in part, by Y2K being the driving force behind the project rather than defined business performance improvement objectives. With Y2K as the driver, ERP became a software replacement project, and after expenditure approval, management often stepped aside and let information technology and systems integrators take over the installation of software. In cases like this, there are no meaningful strategic and tactical objectives and therefore, by definition, no business performance-oriented metrics can reasonably exist â never mind performance improvements.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Yet, too often management wonders why its expectations, often set by others, are nowhere near being reached. There are managers, depending upon their function and position, who are comfortable working with expense and profit numbers and others who are equally comfortable working with revenue and market share. The typical ERP system justification is so often driven by functions such as manufacturing, finance, materials and information technology, which are functions that are generally more comfortable working with so-called tangibles such as expenses, profit, inventory investment and the like.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Some are of the opinion that many aspects of ERP ROI are so well-hidden that they cannot be reasonably measured. The not-so-obvious benefits, which some like to call soft or intangible, are where people really get hung up, and very little or no time is spent trying to predict the economic impact. In companies where the CEO is strategy-oriented, these numbers are not considered soft, but are specific, targeted objectives guided by action plans that have specific metrics to gauge the expected incremental performance improvement. Simply put, if you can develop and apply reasonable metrics to intangibles such as customer satisfaction, communication, decision cycle time, decision-making quality, cycle time, delivery performance, etc., then it is very likely the economic impact can be reasonably predicted.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Unfortunately, many executives associated with increasing revenue and market share are not involved enough in ERP and supply chain management system planning and implementation. As a result, the top-line numbers for justification are soft, even though they shouldnât be. Worse yet are implementations that focus on the various hot buttons of the moment in manufacturing, accounting, engineering and information technology. The fact is, strategy and its implementation &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;are often not considered in ERP system planning and implementation and, therefore, ROI from strategic improvements does not materialize.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;ERPâs strategic drivers &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One of the most important issues is how more effective supply chain management can improve revenue and market share as well as lower costs. With management compelled by common sense and the desire to achieve and maintain an edge in the marketplace, supply chain management has become the collaborative extension of internal operations between customers and suppliers. The concept of one set of numbers for everyone has been around, at least in theory, for some time, the objective being a better coordinated management team thatâs all on the same page. The concept of a single set of better numbers brings a much expanded and very important meaning to coordinating customersâ needs with production scheduling and supplier requirements in collaborative supply chain management.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Review and revise &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Today, nearly every management group needs to review and revise its supply chain management strategy often, in the pursuit of achieving and maintaining a competitive edge. Companies considering a new ERP system, as an enabler to more effective supply chain management, need to get to the heart of ROI early in the planning process. Management needs to ask some challenging, broad-ranging questions, and seek answers that demonstrate a tie-in to the companyâs overall goals and objectives. Asking tough questions and making sure the answers are solid and as fact-based as possible should help to clarify many issues and priorities, such as:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP help us to improve customer satisfaction? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP contribute to increasing our market share? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP decrease our operating expenses? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP help to increase revenue? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP decrease our inventory investment? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP shorten our order-to-delivery cycle time? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP help us keep pace with or surpass our competitors? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will ERP shorten our time to market? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Will we be able to reduce our material costs through improved supply base management? How? How much and when?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ Have we appropriately defined responsibility and accountability for these business performance improvements?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;â¢ What are the metrics for measuring performance improvement in both tactical and strategic areas?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In my opinion, strategic benefits, with actual results not available for a few years, should be based on solid, time-phased assumptions of outcome and reasonable estimates of likely results. It is much more appropriate to scrutinize ERP up front by establishing realistic objectives and performance measures before any significant commitments are made. Without appropriate performance measurement, realistic accountability is just not possible. To achieve your objectives, you must know the route you are taking and the time it will take to reach your destination or you will never be sure you got there.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There should be no controversy about ROI if you cover both the tactical and strategic issues of how ERP can or cannot support improvements in your business performance. Everyone in the organization needs to understand that positive ROI comes from changing the way business was performed in the past to more streamlined, faster and lower cost processes that better serve the needs of the customer.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you do that very well, it will be a winner.&lt;/P&gt;

            <title>IBM to acquire MRO Software for $740 million</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;IBM and MRO Software Inc. on August 3 announced the two companies have entered into a definitive agreement for IBM to acquire MRO Software Inc., a publicly held company based in Bedford, Mass., in an all-cash transaction at a price of approximately $740 million, or $25.80 per share. The acquisition is subject to MRO Software shareholder and regulatory reviews and other customary closing conditions. It is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2006. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MRO is the leading provider of asset and service management software and consulting, used by many of the world's top companies to efficiently manage how they buy, maintain and retire assets&amp;nbsp;- such as production equipment, facilities, transportation and information technology (IT) hardware and software - in a wide variety of industries including utilities, manufacturing, energy, pharmaceutical and telecommunications. This acquisition builds upon IBM's strategy to leverage business consulting, IT services and software to develop repeatable tools that help clients optimize and transform their businesses. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;As more types of corporate assets are touched by technology, companies are looking for ways to consolidate how they manage these assets - both operational and IT-related. IBM's acquisition of MRO addresses this need by providing customers with a consistent, comprehensive set of asset management solutions and services. MRO asset management technology and consulting services will be integrated into IBM Software and IBM Global Services offerings. As a result of the acquisition of MRO, IBM will be the only company to provide the solution to this convergence of IT and industrial assets. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"In a recent IBM study, 40 percent of CEOs indicated that asset utilization would be a key focus in strengthening financial performance," said Al Zollar, general manager, IBM Tivoli software. "MRO software is a powerful addition to IBM's portfolio of software and services. This acquisition will provide companies with a single view into all of their assets, helping them to maximize efficiencies, drive productivity, and innovate business processes across the enterprise." &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"As technology increasingly becomes the backbone for all business operations, companies require the ability to efficiently manage both industrial and technology assets," said Chip Drapeau, president and CEO, MRO Software. "The IBM acquisition opens a world of opportunity for our clients and our employees. By integrating our asset management capabilities with IBM, a leader in IT management software and asset management consulting, we can offer our customers a complete asset management solution on a global scale." &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;-&lt;SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Build upon the two companies' long-standing business relationship, &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;which began in 1996.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;IBM will leverage MRO's software portfolio and management consultants to provide clients with a single approach to managing all industrial and IT assets. Since MRO's offerings are built on a modern architecture, they can be easily integrated into IBM's service oriented architecture (SOA)-based capabilities, including business process management and IT service management. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;As management processes converge around all types of asset classes, enterprise assets are becoming more intelligent - connecting to IT networks via RFID, for example, and using IP addresses and embedded chips. With a consolidated asset management approach, companies can be more efficient and cut administrative overhead by managing all critical enterprise assets, including industrial equipment in a single, automated environment - the same way many companies currently manage IT assets. By consolidating and automating these processes, companies can establish and automate service levels, separate service delivery from root-cause analysis, and manage the change process. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The acquisition of MRO Software will strengthen the enterprise systems management capabilities of IBM's Tivoli software portfolio, which produced double-digit revenue growth for the first two quarters of 2006, and enhance IBM's already strong asset management consulting capabilities in IBM Global Services. MRO Software has produced double-digit growth since the company reported revenues of $199.2 million for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2005. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MRO has thousands of customers worldwide including: BP, ExxonMobile, China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC), Cargil, Heineken, Frito Lay, Daimler Chrysler, Ford, GM, DTE Energy, Constellation Generation Group, Department of Defense, Department of Treasury, NASA, U.S. Air Force, U.

            <title>Few make the most of their CMMS</title>
            <description>&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;A whopping 94.7 percent of plant maintenance managers feel they are not using their computerized maintenance management software system to its maximum capability, according to the results of a national CMMS survey conducted for &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt; magazine by educator, consultant and author Kris Bagadia.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I knew that it was going to be a high percentage. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know it was going to be that high,&amp;rdquo; says Bagadia, whose extensive survey was completed this past winter by 299 industrial maintenance professionals. &amp;ldquo;I have estimated for years that 80 percent of installations fail. The data in this survey works to confirm that high failure rate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;Besides providing the results to &lt;i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"&gt;Reliable Plant&lt;/i&gt;, Bagadia is using the new data as the focus of his book &amp;ldquo;CMMS Made Simple&amp;rdquo;, which will be published this summer by McGraw-Hill. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Through this project, I wanted maintenance leaders to take a look in the mirror &amp;ndash; look at their system, what they are doing and what they want it to do,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;More often than not, they will find that the CMMS has the capability to do what they need it to do; it&amp;rsquo;s just not being used in that manner. They don&amp;rsquo;t have to make another investment. What they need is the time, training and resources to do more with what they have. In some cases, though, they will find that they made a wrong selection, and it&amp;rsquo;s time to admit it and fix it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;The survey respondents, on average:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;bull; work at a facility with 350 employees&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;bull; manage a maintenance staff of 15 employees&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;bull; oversee the maintenance of 938 plant assets&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;bull; employ CMMS systems that track 2,500 spare parts, and issue 100 work orders and 25 purchase orders per week&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;Obstacles to hurdle&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;The fact that maintenance departments struggle to get the most out of their CMMS systems shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a surprise. A host of studies on this subject have been conducted over the past decade. But, 94.7 percent? That&amp;rsquo;s a figure that displays the full extent of the problem. It also shows that little progress has been made over the past decade to solve maintenance&amp;rsquo;s challenges, confusion and frustration in this area.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;Comments on the survey forms frankly list a myriad of factors that explain CMMS suboptimization:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The program being used is way too complicated.&amp;rdquo; (That&amp;rsquo;s not surprising since nearly three out of 10 survey respondents said it took between one year and three years to implement their CMMS system.)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We aren&amp;rsquo;t using the data to make decisions. The CMMS is more of an automated record keeper than an analysis tool.&amp;rdquo; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;There are more modules than we have the capacity to use.&amp;rdquo; (CMMS modules used by respondents are: preventive maintenance, 86.4 percent; work order, 83.5 percent; equipment, 78 percent; inventory, 43.2 percent; and purchase order, 29.7 percent).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an old system that needs an upgrade.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The software has limitations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It would take precious hours. It&amp;rsquo;s not just hours sitting at a machine, but training time to learn about the program so that new information can be used effectively.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It has modules &amp;ndash; parts inventory, POs, etc. &amp;ndash; that aren&amp;rsquo;t currently being used. The reason is the time and data collection needed to load the module.&amp;rdquo; (More than one in four respondents said it took between 100 and 200 hours of maintenance employees&amp;rsquo; time to collect data for CMMS implementation; nearly one in four said it took more than 500 hours).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Our maintenance technicians are not computer literate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;It poorly interfaces with the accounting and SAP software. That leads to double entry of all POs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a lack of expertise to learn and maintain the system, and a lack of clerical help for inputting the data. The data has more capabilities, but we don&amp;rsquo;t have enough resources to utilize them.&amp;rdquo; (Three out of five respondents use clerical support to enter data; on average, this support enters data 20 hours per week.)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;span style="mso-spacerun: yes"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The products we have used are far too cumbersome and complex for our needs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We must apply our limited resources to putting out fires.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;We receive little support from our information technology group.&amp;rdquo; (A total of 32.9 percent of respondents said MIS/IT doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the system a high priority.)&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;The bottom line?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;With feedback such as this, is it any wonder that the survey respondents point to less-than-stellar returns from their CMMS investment?&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;When asked what percent of their total maintenance budget has been saved as a result of better scheduling through their CMMS, nearly three out of 10 respondents said &amp;ldquo;5 or less percent.&amp;rdquo; Savings as a result of increased spare parts availability? Four out or 10 said &amp;ldquo;5 or less percent.&amp;rdquo; Savings as a result of increased machine availability? One in three said &amp;ldquo;5 or less percent.&amp;rdquo; Savings as a result of better inventory control? Again, one in three said &amp;ldquo;5 or less percent.&amp;rdquo; These return-on-investment results just might explain why only 77.5 percent of respondents said that their upper management is committed to the maintenance department&amp;rsquo;s CMMS program.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;A CMMS, used properly, can help you do more, do it more efficiently, and do it with less,&amp;rdquo; says Bagadia. &amp;ldquo;Most maintenance departments, though, aren&amp;rsquo;t realizing all of the gains. To turn the tide, it&amp;rsquo;s going to take some serious commitment on somebody&amp;rsquo;s part. Maintenance has to be committed to this as an improvement tool. MIS&amp;rsquo;s lack of involvement and support? That has to change. Part of it also lies with upper management. Unless they are committed to this and unless they take maintenance seriously, it will not change. They give maintenance the software, but they won&amp;rsquo;t provide the $5,000 or $10,000 for training. All those factors added together could well explain why maintenance only uses the system to submit work orders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;Bagadia believes a system audit is a necessary first step to improvement.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;Either by yourself or through an outside firm, you need do an annual audit,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;You need to see what the system is doing. Is it doing what&amp;rsquo;s expected, or can it do more?&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;b style="mso-bidi-font-weight: normal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;The future&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;The survey showed that only around one in four respondents currently use imaging options in the CMMS to attach CAD drawings, digital photos or scanned images to records. Just one in four use handheld devices (PDAs, bar code scanners, etc.) in conjunction with the system. Bagadia sees great potential in such applications.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: arial; color: black; font-size: 10pt"&gt;&amp;ldquo;I think these are areas of huge, huge opportunity for improvement,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;That is where everybody has to go. This is relatively untapped. We should be talking more about these types of applications. These can really increase your efficiency and productivity.&amp;rdquo;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;

            <title>Gartner report gives high marks to Infor's Datastream</title>
            <description>Infor on May 30 announced that Datastream has been positioned by analyst firm Gartner Inc. in the Leaders Quadrant of its Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Asset Management (EAM). Datastream, recently acquired by Infor, forms Infor's comprehensive EAM solution. Infor is the largest global software provider focused on delivering world-class enterprise applications to select verticals in the manufacturing and distribution industries.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to Gartner, vendors evaluated in magic quadrant reports can be grouped into one of four categories: Leaders, Challengers, Visionaries and Niche Players. Gartner assesses companies based on "completeness of vision" and "ability to execute."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Leaders are those vendors that would normally be included in shortlists worldwide for EAM products for mainstream industries that rely on assets," wrote Kristian Steenstrup and Billy Maynard, in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Asset Management, published March 29, 2006. "They perform profitably, grow their revenue and have a presence in all major markets. Their functionality is above average (catering to advanced maintenance strategies), and their technology and scalability are leading edge. These vendors would be followed and tracked by other EAM vendors."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Infor's success is based on Datastream 7i, the company's flagship EAM solution. Datastream 7i provides an asset management platform to hundreds of customers, including Oak Ridge National Labs, Nucor Steel, GlaxoSmithKline, and Miami-Dade County, Florida.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;According to the report, "Best-of-breed EAM products (and computerized maintenance management system [CMMS]) have been migrating upward in scalability to cater to many hundreds of concurrent users, as well as multiple sites."&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"We continue to achieve rapid growth in revenue and market share with Datastream 7i, and are pleased that Gartner placed our solution in the Leaders Quadrant," said Jerry Rulli, senior vice president and general manager of the Infor Cross Industry Solutions group. "We believe our success is driven by our ability to consistently deliver an effective combination of product and services, which translates directly into successful customer deployments. We plan to build on this success through the coming year with new product features and services to give our customers the world's most advanced EAM solutions."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/W5CSqZmu7QY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

ECPWeb is an independent research analyst and publishing organization covering technology asset, service and software management.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;In a survey that included vendors such as &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;BMC&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;CA&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt; and HP, MRO Software bested them all with a 3.95 rating for its Maximo ITAM, a component of Maximo Enterprise Suite (MXES). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âMRO Softwareâs Maximo ITAM received the highest rating for business value functions of the all suite tools we reviewed,â said Steven Russman, managing partner and publisher, ECPWeb.com. âCreated from the ground up, it has everything youâd expect from a leading tool for IT asset management repository.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MXES includes key ITAM capabilities and advanced IT Service Desk functionality, enabling companies to consolidate their disparate IT Service Management (ITSM) systems onto one modern platform. In addition to the systems consolidation, MXES allows consolidation of key ITSM business processes including incident and problem management and change and configuration management leveraging a single Configuration Management Database (CMBD). With a single modern platform, MXES can leverage the common business processes between ITAM and ITSM.&amp;nbsp;This consolidated service approach provides improved responsiveness and performance while reducing the costs associated with managing multiple systems.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;While MXES earned high marks across the board, ECPWeb said the software suite stood out for its inventory management, vendor and catalog management, and configurable workflow features. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âThe systemâs programmable workflow designer configures and saves activities with rules for execution. We rate this fully Web-deployed suite a solid 4.5 for its usability and well-designed user interface, full security and audit control for creating user rights, roles and profiles. Unlike many systems we review, end users may be granted rights to customize their personal data views,â said Russman.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âWe are pleased that MXES received the highest ranking for business value from ECPWeb,â said Rich Caplow, director of product marketing for MRO Software. âIn addition to building solutions that are completely web architected, we make every effort to ensure that the business processes we support are driving value for the customer as well. ECPWebâs recognition of MXESâs business value reflects our commitment to providing a solution that is as useful to the business as it is well-designed.â &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MRO Software will be demonstrating the complete functionality of&amp;nbsp; MXES at the Help Desk Institute Conference &amp;amp; Expo, to be held in &lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st="on"&gt;Nashville&lt;/st1:City&gt;, &lt;st1:State w:st="on"&gt;Tenn.&lt;/st1:State&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;, March 19-22. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/Kv47Y7X88ZM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>MRO Software, BearingPoint create alliance</title>
            <description>MRO Software, a provider of asset and service management solutions, and BearingPoint Inc., a global management and technology consulting firm, recently announced an alliance to help companies and organizations identify and implement strategies and solutions to increase return on investment from enterprise assets.
&lt;P&gt;The alliance combines BearingPoint's business and systems consulting experience in developing and implementing industry-specific asset and service management solutions and its ProvenCourse tools and methodologies with MRO Software's Maximo Enterprise Suite (MXES), a set of solutions based on a single platform and common architecture. Together, MRO Software and BearingPoint can assist companies with their efforts to achieve greater efficiency, better manage asset inventory, derive more meaningful metrics and analytics regarding asset and service management, as well as reduce total life cycle costs.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"BearingPoint and MRO Software are coming together to offer clients a detailed set of answers to their questions on how to better manage their companies' assets, including IT systems, facilities and even real estate," said Jill Goff, a managing director with BearingPoint and co-leader of the Real Estate and Capital Assets Solutions practice. "Any downtime, for instance to figure out how to process work orders, or to maintain a large manufacturing system, can cost a company money. BearingPoint and MRO Software can cooperate to offer clients software solutions and services to enable them to improve their businesses' efficiency while reducing costs."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The agreement marks the formalization of an existing multi-year relationship between BearingPoint and MRO Software, which together have implemented solutions for Global 2000 clients.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"Our clients are looking to more effectively manage and maintain their enterprise assets in order to enhance life cycle productivity, while increasing efficiency of operations, which in turn will improve their investments," said Michael Desabris, a senior manager with BearingPoint. "We look forward to continuing our work together with MRO Software to bring this exciting value proposition to our clients to meet their ever-changing enterprise needs."&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;MRO Software's Maximo Enterprise Suite is a comprehensive suite of products that are built on a single, web-architected common platform. The solution combines enhanced Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) functionality with new service management capabilities that together improve the effectiveness of asset management strategies. MXES includes deep and broad functionality for traditional asset and service management, as well as auto discovery of IT assets, advanced IT asset management, and a full-featured service desk based on the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) guidelines. Each product can be implemented separately as a stand-alone solution, or readily deployed together. The solution enhances asset management and ensures service performance of production, facility, transportation and IT assets.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;"This agreement allows BearingPoint to provide to its clients an advanced, industry leading asset management solution," said Patricia C. Foye, executive vice president global marketing and alliances, MRO Software. "The ability to deliver integrated asset and service management solutions has become a critical requirement for many of BearingPoint's most-valued enterprise customers, and BearingPoint has demonstrated the capacity to deliver our combined solutions in the high-quality, cost-effective manner which these customers demand."&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/JJ2GmvF_gVI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>ARC market research report lauds MRO Software</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MRO Software, a provider of asset and service management solutions, announced Wednesday results from a newly released market research report by ARC Advisory Group showing that the company extended its worldwide market share leadership in enterprise asset management (EAM) software during 2005. It marks the fourth consecutive year in which MRO Software has captured the analyst groupâs top market position.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The report, âEnterprise Asset Management/Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (EAM/CMMS) Solutions Worldwide Outlook,â names MRO Software as the overall global market leader, and cites other wins in numerous regional, industry and asset-type market segments, including:&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;North and &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st="on"&gt;Latin America&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;According to the report, MRO Software improved its market position thanks partly to its integration of IT asset and service management into the companyâs Maximo Enterprise Suite (MXES). &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âIts acquisition of MainControl provided the company with an IT asset management solution that was integrated into its Maximo solution in 2005. MRO Software focuses on strategic asset and service management, asset-centric procurement, and an ITIL compliant service desk for production, facilities, fleet and IT asset management. Maximo enjoys major brand recognition and also supports an important services practice for many strategic partners including IBM which promotes the combined EAM and ITEAM focus,â the report said. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The study continues ARCâs annual tracking of the market for EAM/CMMS and Information Technology Enterprise Asset Management (ITEAM) solutions. Market shares and forecasts were estimated for 2005 based upon available financial reports and 2004 base year supplier inputs. It echoes similar market studies from analysts such as the Gartner Inc. and the META Group who have consistently named MRO Software the industry leader year to year. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âARC Advisoryâs report is one of the most exhaustive studies of the EAM industry.

Foye, executive vice president, Global Marketing &amp;amp; Alliances of MRO Software.&amp;nbsp; âWe look forward to building on our strong market presence with MXES.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/4rj9x0PvhPw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Maintenance management legends</title>
            <description>&lt;P&gt;There are many paradigms and legends surrounding maintenance management in plants. Often, the legends are known to be untrue, but people live with them because it is politically correct, or simply convenient. To be successful in improving equipment reliability and maintenance management, plants must break the legends that exist in their organizations. Some of the legends will be addressed in this article. You may find that these legends are uncomfortably close to describing how your plant operates. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 1: Maintenance cost must be reduced quickly &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Plants should reduce maintenance cost. But there are many variables that can be affected by lowering the maintenance budget. It is, therefore, important to consider how the cost cut is implemented. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of us can cut maintenance costs in any plant in the world very quickly by 40 percent. We simply get rid of some people and stop doing certain maintenance jobs. If you get the opportunity to take a job like this, don't plan on staying more than a year. The consequences of short-term maintenance management will most likely be devastating to the total cost, and problems will start to show after a year or two due to ill-maintained assets. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Mandating a plant to lower maintenance costs quickly can be compared to asking a hockey team to increase the average number of goals per game from two goals to four without any coaching or guidance. The team can most likely produce four goals per game, if no other variables are considered. Obviously, we want the hockey team to win, not just score four goals per game. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is a balance between goals scored and goals given up. It is a mystery why many plants don't pick up on this simple concept of balance. It is not uncommon to see an organization completely focused on cost without considering the total picture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If we lower the maintenance budget and don't change other aspects of the business practice, the results will most likely be very poor. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Changes in maintenance cost are interrelated to product quality and production output. A reduction in maintenance cost will not lead to improved quality and production output. But an improvement in equipment reliability will most likely improve production output and quality. Improved quality and production output will reduce maintenance cost. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Maintenance cost cannot be reduced quickly because it takes time to improve equipment reliability. Improved reliability will reduce cost, but reduced cost will not improve reliability. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 2: People don't like change &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;I often hear that people don't like change. In my experience, people love change â they just don't want to be changed by someone else. People are often very receptive to change as long as they are part of the change process. The problem is when a project improvement plan goes through the usual number-crunching, while the involvement of people is often forgotten. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;For example, people in the plant typically can identify planning and scheduling improvement opportunities, yet most of us are reactive by nature; we don't want to work to strict guidelines, such as planning and schedule exactly what to do three days from now. Improving planning and scheduling requires a culture change together with detailed, agreed-upon processes and procedures. Even though we know this, plants sometimes try to improve planning and scheduling by talking over a cup of coffee or, at best, sending a couple of planners on a two-day planning and scheduling course. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Production and operations changes are often 80 to 90 percent dependent on technical solutions including process automation. An equipment reliability and maintenance change initiative is 95 percent dependent on changing peoples' behavior. Management must address the issues of involvement and acceptance while encouraging the few enthusiastic souls in a project. Project success can be expressed as R = Q x A x E (Results = quality of actions x acceptance for change x enthusiasm for change). &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 3: People are our biggest asset &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If you work in plant management or as a corporate officer, it is politically correct to say "people are our biggest asset." Most managers would agree to that statement. I don't agree. People are not a company's biggest asset â the right people are a company's biggest asset, and the wrong people are liabilities. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I confirmed this opinion during a recent seminar for a group of supervisors and craftspeople. One of the discussions started with the question, "Isn't it true that if any given crew in this plant would lose its poorest performing people (about 10 to 20 percent of the total), the loss would hardly be noticed?" After the laughs and pointing had subsided, several people confirmed that there were always a number of people in any given crew who had "never accomplished an honest day's work." These people destroy morale and, in some cases, even slow the rest of the crew down. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management must deal with underperforming people. If you have a decent relationship with your union or your non-union workforce, they are usually receptive to discussing these matters. Poor performers are a big problem for them as well. It is also true that people cannot be more effective than the system in which they work allows them to be. Management can minimize the amount of wasted time and energy by implementing good maintenance and reliability processes. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 4: Having more maintenance people on shift reduces downtime &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;If you have many problems in your plant, operations typically requests more people on shift to fix the breakdowns. If this is the situation in your plant, you are going down the wrong path. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you have a multitude of problems in your plant, you need to find out why and fix the source of the problems. What is the solution for your plant? Most likely, you don't have enough time to repair all equipment problems found in your area, and you don't always find the problems before a breakdown. So, we need more people, right? In the short run, possibly, but not necessarily. Definitely not in the long run. Here is a checklist of possible problems: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do operators perform detailed equipment inspections? If not, make sure operators know how to inspect a bearing, motor, coupling, hydraulic motor, fluid coupling, etc. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do your maintenance people have detailed inspection lists, take readings and analyze trends in order to identify symptoms on equipment? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Do you use your craftspeople by having well-planned jobs for them? Do you schedule maintenance jobs in coordination with operations? By executing high-quality inspections, we can make sure that we know about most symptoms. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 5: We can't motivate maintenance craftspeople to improve reliability because they make more money when things break down &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;Maintenance people typically do make more money when things break down. A perceived Catch-22 by maintenance management is that crews can't be motivated to improve reliability and maintenance because higher equipment reliability will reduce the amount of overtime. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, the answer to the question goes back to Legend 3. Only a minor percentage of people don't contribute as well as others; the rest of us want to be good performers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The key word is pride. Pride matters more than overtime pay. Pride drives a relatively low-paid U.S. Marine to risk his or her life for months at a time. Pride drives a maintenance craftsperson to spend an extra hour or two to align a pump to one-thousandth of an inch even though few will notice. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Management can instill pride in an organization by developing clear expectations for reliability and maintenance, and by training and supporting people long term in achieving these expectations. For example, develop a clear definition of preventive maintenance and develop an action plan and training initiatives on how to improve inspection routes, lubrication, cleaning practices, operating procedures, alignment and other preventive maintenance practices. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Since money also is a motivator, provide incentive pay for equipment reliability. One of the fastest preventive maintenance program setups we have seen was at a car manufacturing plant in Europe that offered its crews (operations and maintenance) a bonus on each percentage over 97 percent line efficiency. The results appeared on reports just weeks after the announcement â the actual equipment reliability improvement probably started hours after the announcement. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 6: New computer software will improve reliability and maintenance performance &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It is not unusual to see a maintenance organization implement a new CMMS with the hopes that this new computer software will improve plant reliability. In truth, new software can be a great help, but it is only a tool. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If plant performance improves following a software change, it is not the software itself that contributes the majority of improvements. Improvements will be a synthesis of the implementation and execution of better work processes, behavior changes and higher-quality data from the software. The obvious question then becomes, "Can't the plant improve work processes, behaviors and data quality with the old CMMS?" &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Sometimes maintenance software updates become so cumbersome that a plant disregards obvious fundamentals due to work overload. For example, the bill of material for equipment isn't always up to date in the old system, and it will not be up to date in the new system unless an effort is made to improve the data. It is a common argument that it costs too much to update the bill of materials, yet we accept the cost of having each craftsperson use a significant amount of time every day looking for parts. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In some plants, training is reduced to a minimum and often performed several months before the system is put in use. The result is that, at best, about 30 percent of the CMMS functionality is used and that only 30 percent of the people know how to use it effectively. This results in a 9 percent usage of the system. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If your organization is ready to implement a new CMMS, make sure you update the bill of materials, standard job plans, equipment numbering and asset numbering in the old system. Also, ask yourself if you plan and schedule jobs well today. If not, the problem is usually not the software. People will blame the software because it can't talk back, but the real problems are lack of discipline in backlog management, prioritization issues, and the inability of operations and maintenance to coordinate production and maintenance schedules. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Legend 7: Equipment criticality decides inspection frequency &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;It is common to see plants base component inspection frequency on a criticality analysis study. At first, it may seem sensible to base inspection frequency on criticality of equipment, but let's illustrate the misconception with an example. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Let's assume we are setting the inspection frequency for a very simple component such as a bolt. Let's assume the bolts in question are holding a mechanical seal on a pump. The pump and seal are very critical according to the criticality study. The inspection frequency for the highest criticality score is often recommended to one inspection every shift. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Intuitively, you notice that it doesn't make any sense to inspect a bolt every shift. Why? Because the inspection frequency must be based on how long, on average, it takes to develop a failure in a component. The bolt in our example will not fail from one shift to another unless there is a completely random event. The most likely failure is that the bolt comes loose over a two- to six-month period. We should therefore set the inspection frequency according to the Failure Developing Period (FDP), by estimating the FDP, and set the inspection frequency to FDP over two. In our example, we estimate an FDP of four months and set the inspection frequency to two months. &lt;/P&gt;

            <title>MRO Software unveils MXES Mobile Suite</title>
            <description>&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MRO Software,&amp;nbsp;a provider of asset and service management solutions, on Wednesday announced the availability of its new line of mobile-enabled solutions for its Maximo Enterprise Suite (MXES). This new solution was designed from the ground up within the MXES architecture, and supports companiesâ efforts to significantly cut the time, cost, paperwork and delays of servicing mission-critical assets in a distributed environment. MXES Mobile Suite allows for employees to be more productive by enabling them to efficiently perform critical work, and access critical asset and process data wherever and whenever needed, using handheld devices and mobile phones.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;MXES Mobile represents the next phase of the companyâs roll out of MXES solutions. These mobile solutions are designed and built into the MXES service-oriented architecture. The mobile solution lets customers take full advantage of MXESâs workflow, business rules, business objects and easy application configuration, without the need for third-party solutions. These new solutions seamlessly extend the reach and accessibility of the core MXES functionality, allowing remote users to benefit from the enhanced asset and service management capabilities that MXES delivers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;"Our research shows that users will not accept critical business applications unless they are available on a mobile platform.&amp;nbsp; The ability to provide the full functionality to the remote user enhances application usability and criticality.&amp;nbsp; Vendors that can provide this complete capability stand to benefit by gaining a greater wallet share,â said Michael Maoz, vice president, research fellow, Gartner Inc.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Initial applications for the MXES Mobile Suite include the Maximo Mobile for Work Management, which provides remote, real-time access to work and asset data necessary to complete work and service management tasks, and Maximo Mobile for Inventory Management, which gives paperless inventory and receiving control. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;âA recent ARC survey identified the use of mobile solutions for asset management as an important trend that can increase productivity and improve workflow when properly deployed,â said Houghton LeRoy, research director at ARC Advisory Group. âThe new embedded MXES Mobile Suite from MRO Software better addresses productivity and workflow by downloading only what is needed and by working with or without a live connection with minimal disruption. A practical design positions PDAs for the more complex work order and inventory management functions and limits cell phone usage to simple communications such as dispatching and notification. Since the MXES Mobile Suite is developed and embedded by MRO Software, customers should not have to deal with costly incompatibility issues that require partner solution updates.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;The new connected and disconnected features of the MXES Mobile platform allows the mobile applications to dynamically connect to the server as required, based on user profiles and available wireless connectivity.&amp;nbsp; The MXES Mobile Suite enables employees to both capture data in the field during maintenance or inventory procedures, as well as providing dynamic access to critical and related information about those procedures. At the same time, managers can assign and re-prioritize work as necessary in real-time and manage and receive valuable, up-to-the-minute information about field service performance.&amp;nbsp; &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Foye, executive vice president global marketing and alliances at MRO Software. âCustomers now have a single, familiar, easy-to-use interface with access to the critical asset and service management functionality that a distributed workforce needs.â&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"&gt;&lt;SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"&gt;Using open standards and a Java 2 Micro Edition&amp;nbsp;runtime profiles, MRO Software has combined the portability of Java technology with open, industry standards to deliver a comprehensive solution for extending many of the MXES existing business processes onto mobile devices. MXES Mobile Suiteâs work management and inventory applications run on Microsoft Windows Mobile-based devices. Cell phone-based applications based on light-weight java profile are scheduled for release later this year. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/CMMS_and_EAM/~4/MJTzFbAuCE4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
