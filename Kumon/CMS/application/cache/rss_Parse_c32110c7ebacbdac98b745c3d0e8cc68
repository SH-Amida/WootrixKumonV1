			<description>Is investment in research to develop new treatments the best approach to controlling cancer? Many people believe that the time is right for another big push to defeat cancer, including President Obama, who called for a major cancer-fighting campaign in his final State of the Union address. But in a new paper, this kind of effort will never cure cancer without public health and prevention.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/yFpc4F9vqns" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Improved screening and detection efforts, combined with decreases in risk factors like smoking, have reduced the incidence and mortality rates from several common types of cancer in many high-income countries. However, many low- and middle-income countries have seen cancer rates rise, partially due to increases in risk factors that are typical of Western countries.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/IkN1vk4oUxs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Discovery contributes towards future treatment of cervical cancer</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~3/gEva6magfoU/151204094348.htm</link>
			<description>Future treatment of cervical cancer has been advanced by a new discovery, reports a team of scientists. Oncoviruses (cancer-causing viruses) are said to account for about 12% of new cancer cases annually. Cervical cancer, which is the cancer of the cervix, accounts for about 8% of all cancer cases worldwide and is the fourth most common cause of cancer and deaths from cancer in women.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/gEva6magfoU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Cervical pessary does not reduce the rate of preterm births or neonatal complications in twin gestations</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~3/EeGm1Vlsx44/150827142055.htm</link>
			<description>Having twins accounts for only 1.5% of all births but 25% of preterm births, the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide. Successful strategies for reducing singleton preterm births include prophylactic use of progesterone and cervical cerclage in patients with a prior history of preterm birth. To investigate whether the use of a cervical pessary might reduce premature births of twins, an international team of researchers conducted a large, multicenter, international randomized clinical trial (RCT) of approximately 1200 twin pregnancies. They report that placement of a cervical pessary did not reduce spontaneous preterm births or reduce neonatal complications.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/EeGm1Vlsx44" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

The therapy uses a population of cells derived from human embryonic stem cells containing progenitor cells that support nerve cells and can potentially make poorly functioning nerves function better.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/kgWS_PBXfrc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>It has long been known that rates of breast and cervical cancer screening among Latinas are low compared to rates for U.S. women overall. A new study found that age and fear of cancer diagnosis are among the reasons why Latina women do not continue participation following breast and cervical cancer education programs.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/hnXis0nbwV8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) is one of the most common minor surgical procedures in obstetrics and gynecology, used mainly for miscarriage or terminations. Today, use of the 15-minute procedure is declining in favor of less invasive medical methods, but it still remains common in O&amp;G. Although D&amp;C is generally considered safe and easy to perform, it is associated with some serious (if rare) side effects, including perforations to the cervix and uterus, infection, and bleeding. Now, an analysis 21 cohort studies which included almost 2 million women has found that a D&amp;C performed in cases of miscarriage or induced abortion increases the chance of preterm birth (under 37 weeks) in a subsequent pregnancy by 29%, and of very preterm birth (under 32 weeks) by 69%.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/xEoAotPP7n8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Clinical advice has been presented aimed at reducing overuse of cervical cancer screening in average risk women without symptoms. The advice suggests that physicians should start screening average risk women for cervical cancer at age 21 once every three years with cytology tests alone. Physicians may use a combination of cytology and HPV (human papillomavirus) testing once every five years in average risk women age 30 and older who prefer screening less often than every three years. Physicians should stop screening average risk women older than 65 years for cervical cancer who have had three consecutive negative cytology results or two consecutive negative cytology plus HPV test results within 10 years with the most recent test performed within five years.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/KTFpwGt51dE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

The HPV vaccine, which protects against four types of HPV shown to cause cervical cancer and anogenital warts, is offered free through school-based programs to young girls across Canada. Despite the fact the vaccine is free, vaccine rates are lower than expected a number of regions, in part because parents perceive their daughter's level of sexual activity as low at young ages.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/v0lmYG3KgBE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Female IBD patients: Stay up-to-date on your cervical cancer screening</title>

			<description>Women with inflammatory bowel disease may be at increased risk of cervical dysplasia and cancer, according to a new study. Although patients with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease -- the two most common forms of IBD -- had higher odds of being diagnosed with cervical cancer before IBD, only patients with Crohn's disease were at an increased risk of developing cervical cancer after the IBD diagnosis, this study demonstrated.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/hKoYfyF2f7g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Urging HPV vaccine for boys could protect more people at same price</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~3/RUqCNX0gaZI/150311124647.htm</link>
			<description>Whether vaccinating U.S. boys against HPV in addition to girls is worth the cost has been hotly debated. But with HPV-related cancers in men on the rise, and coverage in girls stagnating below the levels needed to ensure that most people are protected, research suggests that devoting a portion of HPV funding to boys -- rather than merely attempting to improve female coverage -- may protect more people for the same price.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/RUqCNX0gaZI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A new study shows that guidance from trained navigators can help patients overcome health-care inequities. Community navigators worked with uninsured Spanish-speaking women to obtain timely follow-up care after an abnormal breast or cervical cancer screening result. Postponed diagnosis after an abnormal test can lead to less effective treatment and lower chances of survival.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/mjJsrJAWB94" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>New HPV vaccine offers greater protection against cervical cancer than current vaccine</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~3/Fxm6KJ8sSjM/150218191855.htm</link>
			<description>Scientists have developed a new HPV (human papilloma virus) vaccine which protects against nine types of the virus -- seven of which cause most cases of cervical cancer. The new vaccine offers significantly greater protection than the current vaccine, which protects against only two cancer causing types of HPV.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/Fxm6KJ8sSjM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~3/xQNHUnvzCcI/150213165047.htm</link>
			<description>According to a multinational clinical trial involving nearly 20,000 young women, the human papilloma virus vaccine, Cervarix, not only has the potential to prevent cervical cancer, but was effective against other common cancer-causing human papillomaviruses, aside from just the two HPV types, 16 and 18, which are responsible for about 70 percent of all cases. That effectiveness endured for the study's entire follow-up, of up to four years.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/xQNHUnvzCcI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Common surgical procedures used to diagnose and treat precancerous cervical lesions do not decrease women's chances of becoming pregnant, according to a new study that followed nearly 100,000 women for up to 12 years. To the contrary, researchers found that women who had one of these procedures were actually more likely to become pregnant than women who did not have a procedure.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/XuYZdczUMNM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A virus is responsible for most cases of cervical cancer, but a new study indicates that only about half of the girls receive the vaccine at the recommended age. The Human papilloma virus vaccine protects against 70 percent of cervical cancers. The CDC has recommended that girls get the vaccine when they are 11-12, because it is most effective when it is given before girls become sexually active.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/HIuNNxmpbv0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Hyaluronon (HA) has been identified by researchers as a critical substance made by the body that protects against premature births caused by infection. Hyaluronon is a natural substance found in many tissues, and is both a lubricant and a beneficial component of eyes, joints, and skin. It has long been thought to play an essential role in increasing the cervix's flexibility during the birth process.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/aYh9nQLXHOc" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The cause of prostate cancer may be linked to Parkinsonâs disease through a common enzyme family called sirtuins. Finding an enzyme that regulates this process could provide excellent new prevention approaches for this common malignancy, researchers say. Sirtuin enzymes have been implicated in neurodegeneration, obesity, heart disease, and cancer.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/cervical_cancer/~4/JWqvPwIJSpU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
