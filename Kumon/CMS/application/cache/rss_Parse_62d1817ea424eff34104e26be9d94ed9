    <title>This Is How to Stop the Zika Virus</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546331/this-is-how-to-stop-the-zika-virus/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Halting the explosive spread of Zika means waging war with mosquitoes. There are several ways, old and new, to win that war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zika virus is out of control. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization called it an âexplosiveâ epidemic, and officials in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the disease, have admitted that they are âlosing badlyâ to the disease. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff went so far as to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/27/zika-virus-brazil-war-on-mosquitos-microcephaly&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;declare war on &lt;em&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the mosquito that transmits Zika. Officials in several other countries in the region have &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546041/women-asked-to-avoid-pregnancy-as-zika-epidemic-worsens/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;asked women to consider not getting pregnant&lt;/a&gt; until the epidemic is brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>The Drug That Killed Michael Jackson Is Helping Us Unravel the Mystery of Consciousness</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546291/the-drug-that-killed-michael-jackson-is-helping-us-unravel-the-mystery-of-consciousness/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;Using the powerful anesthetic propofol, researchers have begun to pick apart how human brain activity gives rise to consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although doctors have been giving general anesthesia to patients for more than 150 years, the mechanism by which it puts people under is still &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/426432/the-mystery-behind-anesthesia/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;a medical mystery&lt;/a&gt;. Unraveling that mechanism could shed light on another mystery: how consciousness works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;A scientist sought the Vaticanâs approval for mixing human cells in animal embryos. And the Pope said yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Spanish scientist working at the Salk Institute in California told &lt;em&gt;Scientific American&lt;/em&gt; that Pope Francis personally blessed his cutting-edge research to mix human cells into animal bodies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Immune System Offers Major Clue to Schizophrenia</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546136/immune-system-offers-major-clue-to-schizophrenia/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A massive genetic study has sketched out a molecular link between schizophrenia and how the brain is shaped in adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning a rare insight into the cause of schizophrenia and possible ways to treat it, scientists in Boston say they have identified a biochemical pathway that contributes to the disease by altering connections between brain cells.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;Physicists have worked out how to measure the magnetic fields generated by single nerves from outside the body and at room temperature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biologists have known that nerves produce and respond to electrical signals since the 18th century, when Luigi Galvani discovered that the muscles in a frogâs leg twitch when stimulated by a spark.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Can the Lead Poisoning in Flint Be Fixed?</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546121/can-the-lead-poisoning-in-flint-be-fixed/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;What are the prospects for helping the children of Flint, or children with lead poisoning anywhere?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been a disaster in painfully slow motion. When the city of Flint, Michigan, switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in 2014, citizens almost immediately complained about the possibility that their water was tainted with lead. They were right, and the water source was switched back in October 2015. But a state of emergency was declared in December, and as of the end of last year, 114 children under age six were shown to have elevated levels of lead in their blood.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Women Asked to Avoid Pregnancy as Zika Epidemic Worsens</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/546041/women-asked-to-avoid-pregnancy-as-zika-epidemic-worsens/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;As the outbreak spreads, affected countries may look toward a technological solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zika virus is spreading in the Americas, and is now expected to reach nearly every country, including the United States. Since it first appeared in Brazil in May 2015, over a million cases have been reported in that country alone. Symptoms are usually mild, but the virus is thought to be responsible for 3,500 cases of infants born with abnormally small heads, a debilitating condition known as microcephaly. Late last week, countries in Central and South America began taking the dramatic step of urging women to hold off on getting pregnant. In Colombia, the recommended hiatus is six to eight months. In El Salvador the government has gone even further, asking women to consider &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/as-zika-virus-spreads-el-salvador-asks-women-not-to-get-pregnant-until-2018/2016/01/22/1dc2dadc-c11f-11e5-98c8-7fab78677d51_story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;avoiding pregnancy until 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Jamaica and Honduras have made similar pleas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <description>&lt;p&gt;They spin in their cages and donât interact. The scientists who created autistic monkeys say theyâll now try to cure them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists in China say they used genetic engineering to create monkeys with a version of autism, an achievement that could make it easier to test treatments but that raises thorny practical and ethical questions over how useful such animal models will be.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>A Peek Inside a Dead Football Playerâs Brain</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545651/a-peek-inside-a-dead-football-players-brain/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;The brains that come through Ann McKeeâs lab donât lie. But they are only the beginning of the story about head trauma and its role in neurodegenerative disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brain on the table once belonged to a pro football player. Itâs also much bigger than average, so it may have been the brain of a very big manâperhaps he played lineman. Those are the only things I know about it before &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bu.edu/alzresearch/about-us/team/faculty/mckee/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Ann McKee&lt;/a&gt; starts cutting it into pieces.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    <title>Using Patient Fingerprints to Break Down Medical Record Silos</title>
    <link>http://www.technologyreview.com/news/545566/using-patient-fingerprints-to-break-down-medical-record-silos/</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;A startup uses encryption and fingerprint authentication to compare medical records across providersâand aims to make them easier to move, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the over 40 million people served by the more than 300 health systems working with startup &lt;a href=&quot;http://crosschx.com/about/&quot; target=&quot;0&quot;&gt;CrossChx&lt;/a&gt;, checking in for a doctorâs appointment is much like unlocking an iPhone. All you need is your right index finger. Touch it onto a fingerprint reader at the check-in desk, and your identity is verified. Your driverâs license can stay in your wallet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
