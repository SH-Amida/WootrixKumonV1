			<title>State laws boost flu vaccination rates in health care workers</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~3/IonZGik0qG8/160302121329.htm</link>
			<description>State laws mandating influenza immunization for people who work in health care increase their vaccination rates, according to new research. From 2000 to 2005, only Maine and New Hampshire had flu vaccine requirement laws for health care workers. During that period, the average flu vaccination rate for health care workers was 22.5 percent. From 2006 to 2011--when 19 other states, including Pennsylvania, passed similar laws--the average vaccination rate for health care workers increased to 50.9 percent.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/IonZGik0qG8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Parents who do not get their children flu shots rate flu vaccine less favorably than other childhood vaccines, a national poll finds. Fifty-nine percent of parents whose child did not receive the flu vaccine this season say it is less important than other childhood vaccines -- compared to only 14 percent of parents whose child got a flu shot, according to a new report.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/ZqL3jZZjOKI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Pregnant women are at higher risk for serious illness and complications, including death, from influenza. For expectant mothers hospitalized with flu, early treatment with the influenza antiviral drug oseltamivir may shorten their time in the hospital, especially in severe cases, suggests a new study. The findings also underscore the importance of flu vaccination for this risk group.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/ySzSs2l91V0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Cities with teams in the Super Bowl see a rise in flu deaths, new research shows. The effects are greater when the Super Bowl occurs close to the peak of flu season or when the dominant influenza strain is more lethal. Models show this year's flu season could be a mild one, but the virus will still kill thousands of people and sicken many more.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/yAaemr29DY0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Effectiveness of influenza vaccine for pregnant women may differ by trimester</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~3/7fD9C-YQnFw/160201215637.htm</link>
			<description>The Centers for Disease Control recommends that all pregnant women get a flu shot, unless they have already been vaccinated over the past year. Cautioning that "Flu is more likely to cause severe illness in pregnant women than in healthy women who are not pregnant," the CDC website recommends that pregnant women may safely get the shot during any trimester. In the study to be presented, researchers found that the T-follicular helper cell response to vaccination is greatest during the first trimester of pregnancy.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/7fD9C-YQnFw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~3/KMQk2VuST4g/160119141923.htm</link>
			<description>Influenza causes serious illness among millions of people each year, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Those most at risk include infants younger than six months, because they cannot be vaccinated against the disease. Now, researchers have identified a naturally occurring protein that, when added to the flu vaccine, may offer protection to babies during their first months of life.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/KMQk2VuST4g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~3/giTuyZz-LJk/160104125332.htm</link>
			<description>Minor variants of flu strains, which are not typically targeted in vaccines, carry a bigger viral punch than previously realized, a team of scientists has found. Its research, which examined samples from the 2009 flu pandemic in Hong Kong, shows that these minor strains are transmitted along with the major strains and can replicate and elude immunizations.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/giTuyZz-LJk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>A person's first infection with the influenza virus likely stimulates the production of key antibodies that then shape later immune responses to different seasonal influenza strains. Now researchers provide insights on how exposure to the flu impacts the immune system, which could be valuable for designing more effective and longer-lasting vaccines.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/4Ce85Fz9u4s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Thanks to 'big data', researchers have identified new molecules that are instrumental in the replication of the flu virus. If these host proteins are blocked, influenza viruses are unable to multiply as effectively. The international study therefore makes a significant contribution towards the development of new treatments and flu drugs.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/6OXpjksF0to" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

The research in mice could lead to better seasonal flu vaccines for humans, and also vaccines that could provide community protection in the early stages of an outbreak of a novel flu virus strain.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/UGMC_7O0J0c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The world-wide deployment of biomedical devices for health monitoring, point-of-care diagnostics and environmental sensing is hampered by their high cost that is not readily affordable for developing countries. The primary task of a new project is therefore to reduce the price of the devices and allow for their high-volume delivery in a cost efficient manner. For the latter, a crucial aspect is to reduce the weight of the device.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/45nl0Wfkh6k" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<title>Immune response to a flu protein yields new insights into narcolepsy</title>
			<link>http://feeds.sciencedaily.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~3/kQPEYLk5tHw/150701151828.htm</link>
			<description>Some of the first solid evidence that narcolepsy may be a so-called 'hit-and-run' autoimmune disease has been uncovered by an international team of researchers. Autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, are well-known for taking decades to ravage the nervous system, joints or other organ systems. But since the late 1990s, researchers have hypothesized a different kind of autoimmune disease, one that may incur rapid, pinpoint damage and leave virtually no trace of its work. Narcolepsy is suspected of being one of these hit-and-run diseases.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/kQPEYLk5tHw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>The flu virus can be lethal. But what is often just as dangerous is the body's own reaction to the invader. The immune counterattack can end up harming the body's own tissues, causing deadly damage. Now, a researcher has, for the first time, uncovered new details about how this response plays out. And he has identified a 'decoy' molecule that can rein in this runaway inflammatory response.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/xM15HGxQUsk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Viruses like influenza have the ability to mutate over time, and given that the flu vaccines administered during the 2014-2015 season were largely ineffective at preventing the spread of the flu, it appears the virus that recently circulated had taken on mutations not accounted for when last year's vaccine was developed. Now, researchers have identified specific mutations that influenza recently acquired to escape the current vaccine design.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/DdPHNviYvS8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Swine farmers are six times more likely to be carriers of staph bacteria, including the MRSA strain, than others, new research shows. S. aureus is a type of bacteria commonly found on the skin as well as in the noses and throats of people and animals. About 30 percent of the U.S. population carries these bacteria, which can cause a range of skin and soft tissue infections. Although most infections are minor, S. aureus can sometimes cause serious infections.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/h3jBtG2oFrE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Children with neurologic or neurodevelopmental disorders (NNDDs) are at increased risk of complications from influenza. Although experts have recognized NNDDs as high-risk conditions for influenza complications since 2005, little is known about influenza vaccination practices in this population.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/EaP45P6rtqo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>New research findings parallel earlier results: Adding a strain of influenza B could improve effectiveness of an influenza vaccine. Findings from this study of flu vaccines delivered by a small needle intradermally parallel earlier results that found adding a strain of influenza B could improve the effectiveness of a flu vaccine nasal spray and a traditional intramuscular vaccine that is injected as a shot in the arm muscle. All studies showed the addition of the B strain improved the antibody response to that strain and didn't weaken the body's immune response to other flu strains in the vaccine.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/m51n1dgbAYw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

			<description>Adults over the age of 30 only catch flu about twice a decade, a new study suggests. So, while it may feel like more, flu-like illness can be caused by many pathogens, making it difficult to assess how often people are infected by influenza.&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/sciencedaily/health_medicine/swine_flu/~4/fuWWIV4SF4E" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
