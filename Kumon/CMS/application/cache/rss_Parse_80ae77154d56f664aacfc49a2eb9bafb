            <title>GM to Power Texas Assembly Plant with Wind Energy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors (GM) recently announced that its assembly plant in Arlington, Texas, will soon be able to build up to 125,000 trucks a year using wind power from turbines whose blades span the length of a football field in diameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arlington Assembly produces more than 1,200 vehicles daily, including the Chevrolet Suburban and Tahoe, GMC Yukon and Yukon XL, and Cadillac Escalade and Escalade ESV. The 115 million kilowatt hours of renewable energy will be enough to manufacture more than half of the plant&amp;#39;s annual vehicle output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arlington Assembly expects to start using the clean power during the fourth quarter of 2016, avoiding about $2.8 million in energy costs annually. Over the course of 14 years, GM will avoid more than 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to the emissions of 112 million gallons of gasoline consumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our investment is helping accelerate the proliferation of clean energy in Texas and the use of wind as a reliable, renewable source of energy,&amp;quot; said Jim DeLuca, GM executive vice president of global manufacturing. &amp;quot;Our sustainable manufacturing mindset benefits the communities in which we operate across the globe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Renewable energy complements a robust energy efficiency program at the plant. Arlington Assembly recently met the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;#39;s Energy Star Challenge for Industry by reducing the energy intensity of its operations by 10 percent in five years. The plant also is investing in a new paint shop that will use half the energy of the system it will replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Toyota Plant to Generate Electricity from Landfill Gas</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota&amp;#39;s manufacturing plant in Georgetown, Kentucky, recently announced that it will begin generating electricity from methane, a byproduct of trash decomposition at a nearby landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We will generate 1 megawatt (1 million watts) per hour at the site,&amp;quot; said Dave Absher, Toyota&amp;#39;s environmental strategies manager. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s enough annual energy generation to produce approximately 10,000 vehicles. The system can eventually be scaled up to 10 megawatts per hour.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project is a collaboration between the Georgetown manufacturing plant and the Central Kentucky Landfill, which is owned and operated by Waste Services of the Bluegrass. Landfills are required to monitor methane levels and report these levels to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Capturing and burning methane has been determined by the EPA to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The project began in 2010 when the two companies met to discuss the potential. Last fall, Waste Services began installing a methane collection system, and Toyota began installing a generator at the site. An underground electric transmission line runs from the landfill approximately 6.5 miles to deliver electricity to the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota&amp;#39;s global headquarters recently announced its intent to virtually eliminate carbon-dioxide emissions from its vehicles and manufacturing plants by 2050. The launch of the Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, the release of fuel cell patents to other automakers and the development of manufacturing technologies that use hydrogen as a power source are specific initiatives mentioned within the plan. Alternative energy sources such as wind, solar and locally produced renewable energy also will be required to achieve the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The landfill gas generator represents the kind of thinking that our company is asking us to do to reduce our carbon footprint over the next 35 years,&amp;quot; said Kevin Butt, Toyota&amp;#39;s general manager for environment strategies. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a small step, but a significant one. These types of changes to our manufacturing operations coupled with other global initiatives will help us reach this very aggressive goal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>5-S Methods to Enhance Green Manufacturing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2015/10/7/e07cf0e5-7045-4c6d-b0bb-38089df2aad5_green-plant.jpeg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; margin: 7px; float: left;" /&gt;Manufacturing industries play a tug-of-war between the public and private sectors, each demanding the fastest, cheapest and highest quality products with the lowest environmental impact. Cap-and-trade emissions policies, paired with limited natural resources, have changed the face of modern industry. As a result, lean companies, particularly those with established 5-S systems, are one step ahead of the green curve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Lean initiatives work well with green initiatives because you&amp;#39;re looking at costs and how much waste is in the process,&amp;quot; said Michael Sinocchi, executive editor with Productivity Press, which was founded more than 20 years ago when editors began translating the works of leading Japanese industrial experts on the Toyota Production System (TPS), the heart of the improvement strategy now called lean manufacturing. &amp;quot;With lean the goal was to drive waste out of the process and throw those savings back into the product by charging customers less, having shorter lead times and spending less on inventory. Now it&amp;#39;s driven by demand and resources.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	What is Green Manufacturing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Green manufacturing goes one step further than lean, examining the environmental impact of processes and materials used in manufacturing. The correlation between companies that implement lean manufacturing processes and green manufacturing is strong, as a reduction in waste saves both time and materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have examined the relationship between 5-S and green manufacturing. The EPA reports 5-S systems offer several environmental benefits. For instance, painting machines light colors and cleaning windows can decrease the energy needed for lighting. Painting and cleaning also make it easier for workers to notice spills or leaks quickly, lessening spill response time. This can significantly reduce waste generated from spills and clean-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regular cleaning decreases the accumulation of cuttings, shavings, dirt and other substances that can contaminate production processes and result in defects. A reduction in defects will lead to considerable environmental benefits because energy and materials are no longer wasted in producing and disposing of defective products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A 5-S implementation can also significantly reduce the square footage needed for operations by organizing and disposing of unused equipment and supplies. Less storage space means less energy needed to heat and light the space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Removing obstacles and marking main thoroughfares can decrease the potential for accidents that could lead to spills and associated hazardous waste generation, such as spilled material, absorbent pads and clean-up materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Organizing equipment, parts and materials so they are easy to find can also significantly reduce unneeded consumption. Employees are more likely to finish one batch of chemicals or materials before opening or ordering more, resulting in less chemical waste requiring disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Visual cues, such as signs, placards, scoreboards and laminated procedures in workstations, can be used to increase employee understanding of proper waste handling and management procedures, as well as workplace hazards and appropriate emergency response. Various 5-S techniques can also be used to improve labeling of hazardous materials and wastes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, integration with 5-S visual cues and operating procedures can improve employee environmental management through the organization of tools and materials into labeled and color-coded storage locations as well as &amp;quot;kits&amp;quot; that contain just what is needed to perform a task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Examining Waste Beyond the Workspace&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When green manufacturing is incorporated with 5-S best practices, companies examine efficiencies not only within an individual workspace but also through the overall life of their products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Initially companies were only focused on the front end of a product &amp;mdash; how to be the best, the cheapest and the fastest to get it out the door to sell it,&amp;quot; Sinocchi said. &amp;quot;Now companies are looking at the overall life of the product &amp;mdash; what environmental impact it has and whether the same production resources will be available 10-15 years from now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electric cars can be used as a case study. When Ford offered its first electric car, Toyota had already released the Prius 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Companies like Ford were waiting for the customer demand,&amp;quot; Sinocchi said. &amp;quot;Toyota examined the cost of resources like oil and realized this market will change 10-15 years from now. Companies can either sit back and say something will change or somehow plan for it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/n2hrLE9ZFXM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Sonoco Achieves Sustainability Targets</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Sonoco recently reported that it has achieved its five-year global sustainability targets, including significant reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), water usage and development of landfill-free operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Five years ago, we established goals to change our economic, environmental and social performance in aspects that were material to Sonoco and its stakeholders,&amp;quot; said Sonoco president and CEO Jack Sanders. &amp;quot;Our process of change, which is providing us better opportunities to grow through new products, new markets, new customers, new services and new ways of thinking, also has created an environment that allows us to better harness the power of our portfolio and our people to optimize our sustainability performance. As a result, we made significant progress to not just meet but exceed our challenging sustainability goals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Targeted achievements highlighted in the company&amp;#39;s corporate responsibility report include reducing normalized carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by nearly 24 percent over the past five years, with normalized emissions in 2014 dropping nearly 12 percent and direct emissions from Sonoco&amp;#39;s facilities reduced by 21 percent. Much of the emission reduction success was a result of the company&amp;#39;s new biomass cogeneration system at its largest manufacturing complex in Hartsville, South Carolina, where CO2 emissions were reduced by 65 percent since 2009. The company had set a goal of reducing CO2 emissions by 15 percent over the five-year period ending in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Normalized water usage also decreased 40 percent over the past five years due to Sonoco&amp;#39;s investment in a new water cooling and treatment system at the Hartsville complex. Following the completion of the project, water consumption at the plant declined 35 percent in 2014, which is equivalent to saving more than 10 million cubic meters of water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nearly 10 percent of the company&amp;#39;s 336 global operating facilities achieved Sonoco Sustainability Star Awards by reaching landfill-free status of 95-percent waste diversion or higher. In addition, the Sonoco Recycling subsidiary implemented programs for 17 of its customers&amp;#39; facilities to also reach landfill diversion goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to reducing the company&amp;#39;s impact on the environment, Sonoco reported continued improvement in employee safety, engagement and leadership development, including being ranked by AON Hewitt as one of the top 25 global companies for leaders six consecutive times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Using 2014 as the new baseline, Sonoco has made the following sustainability commitments through 2020:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Decrease normalized global energy usage by 1 percent annually, which should result in a further 1-percent reduction in GHG emissions (or reduce CO2 emissions by 5 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reduce normalized water usage by 5 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Achieve landfill-free status at an additional 10 percent of the company&amp;#39;s operations while continuing to work with customers to also reduce their waste going to landfills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Continue to demonstrate improvement in employee safety, diversity and engagement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Founded in 1899, Sonoco is a global provider of a variety of consumer packaging, industrial products, protective packaging and supply chain services. With annualized net sales of approximately $5 billion, the company has 20,800 employees working in more than 330 operations in 34 countries.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Georgia-Pacific Professional Achieves ECOLOGO Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Georgia-Pacific Professional recently announced that it has achieved certification to the new ECOLOGO standard (UL 175) and will carry the mark on a selection of the company&amp;#39;s tissue, towel, napkin and wiper products previously certified under the old ECOLOGO standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ECOLOGO certification is managed by UL Environment, a third-party certification organization. This designation is part of Georgia-Pacific Professional&amp;#39;s ongoing effort to offer sustainable products to the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facilities that manufacture Georgia-Pacific Professional&amp;#39;s ECOLOGO-certified products under the UL 175 standard underwent a rigorous independent review as part of participation in the program. According to UL Environment, the revised UL 175 standard has an even greater focus on protecting human health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sustainability updates to the standard include new criteria on packaging requirements, requirements for the sustainable sourcing of fiber, improved limits on energy consumption, and requirements for biodegradable organic compound additives including optical brighteners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This and other third-party certifications highlight our long-term commitment to sustainability, stewardship and meeting the demands of the marketplace,&amp;quot; said John Mulcahy, vice president of sustainability for Georgia-Pacific Professional. &amp;quot;This commitment includes our pioneering work to use recycled fiber in many of our products and our innovation in creating waste-reducing solutions for our customers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Interstate Power and Light Agrees to Reduce Emissions at Iowa Plants</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In a settlement recently announced by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Justice, Interstate Power and Light, a subsidiary of Alliant Energy, has agreed to install pollution-control technology and meet stringent emission rates to reduce air pollution from the company&amp;#39;s seven coal-fired power plants in Iowa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The settlement also requires Interstate Power and Light to spend a total of $6 million on environmental mitigation projects and pay a civil penalty of $1.1 million to resolve alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;To serve the communities in which they operate, power plants must protect clean air for those living nearby,&amp;quot; said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA&amp;#39;s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. &amp;quot;This case delivers on the goals of EPA&amp;#39;s national enforcement initiative to reduce air pollution from the largest sources. By installing new equipment and funding mitigation projects, Interstate Power and Light can help conserve energy and cut pollution in communities across Iowa.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the settlement, Interstate Power and Light will install and continuously operate new and existing pollution-control technology at its two largest plants in Lansing and Ottumwa, and will retire or convert to cleaner-burning natural gas at its remaining five plants in Burlington, Cedar Rapids, Clinton, Dubuque and Marshalltown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new state-of-the-art pollution controls required by the settlement are expected to cost approximately $620 million. The EPA estimates that the settlement will reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by 32,500 tons per year and nitrogen-oxide emissions by 3,800 tons per year once the settlement is fully implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Interstate Power and Light will also be required to spend $6 million on environmental mitigation projects. The company will choose from five potential projects, including solar energy and anaerobic digester installations, replacing coal-fired boilers at schools with lower-emission equipment, an alternative fuel vehicle replacement program, and a program to help residents change out wood-burning stoves and fireplaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The settlement was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District Court of Iowa for 30 days to allow for public comment. The company is required to pay the penalty within 30 days after the court approves the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>CalStar Opens Mississippi Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CalStar Products recently opened a new 100,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in Columbus, Mississippi. The facility, which is CalStar&amp;#39;s second, sits on 23 acres in the Golden Triangle Industrial Park.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company will run two lines at the plant, each utilizing CalStar&amp;#39;s sustainable manufacturing process. The dry-cast line will manufacture all of CalStar&amp;#39;s brick and Thru-Wall units as well as Holland pavers, while the semi-automated wet-cast line will produce cast stone trim and accent pieces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Columbus has proven to be the ideal second home for CalStar, with a central location in the South, a talented pool of labor and strong local business leadership,&amp;quot; says CalStar CEO Joel Rood. &amp;quot;As CalStar continues its rapid growth trajectory, we knew a second plant was key to expanding production and capabilities. We couldn&amp;#39;t be happier with our decision to open up in Columbus.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are thrilled to welcome CalStar to the Golden Triangle,&amp;quot; says Joe Max Higgins, CEO of the Golden Triangle Development Link. &amp;quot;Their unique innovation and commitment to bring quality jobs to our community are two of the many reasons we&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to working with them as they make Lowndes County their home.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Incorporating up to 37 percent recycled content, CalStar masonry products eliminate the need for kiln-firing or the use of Portland cement to bind concrete masonry products. As a result, each product requires up to 81 percent less energy to make while emitting up to 84 percent less carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SC Johnson Manufacturing Facility Achieves Zero Landfill Status</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SC Johnson recently announced that it has achieved zero landfill status at its eighth global manufacturing facility, demonstrating the company&amp;#39;s continued commitment to minimize its environmental footprint and reduce its global manufacturing waste by 70 percent by 2016. From 2000-2012, the company reduced its global manufacturing waste by 62 percent as a ratio to production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The site in Manaus, Brazil, is the company&amp;#39;s eighth zero landfill facility. Over the last few years, it implemented several initiatives that increased recycling rates, reduced packaging and expanded access to environmental education. SC Johnson&amp;#39;s other zero landfill facilities include two in China and one each in Pakistan, the Netherlands, the United States, Poland and Canada. Through 2012, 10 of SC Johnson&amp;#39;s global manufacturing facilities achieved waste diversion rates of at least 90 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As each of us looks to reduce the amount of waste we generate and increase recycling rates both at home and within our community, SC Johnson is committed to identifying innovative and scalable ways to minimize our global manufacturing footprint,&amp;quot; said Kelly M. Semrau, chief sustainability officer at SC Johnson. &amp;quot;Waste reduction &amp;ndash; and achieving zero landfill &amp;ndash; is a key role in our business strategy to continuously innovate, making even better products in the most sustainable way possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SC Johnson aspires to eliminate waste altogether at each of its manufacturing facilities worldwide. As the company makes continual progress toward reaching this goal, it aims to decrease the amount of waste that is sent to landfills. By fostering a culture of sustainable behavior change throughout its manufacturing facilities and offices worldwide, SC Johnson seeks the proficiency and participation of its employees to identify innovative and scalable solutions to decrease waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the Brazil facility&amp;#39;s journey to achieving zero landfill, onsite leaders examined the site&amp;#39;s entire production chain to identify its primary sources of waste, developed a revised material separation process and an innovative packaging reduction system, and launched an internal campaign to increase awareness around the environmental impact of employees&amp;#39; waste. Since 2012, the facility has prevented an average of 91 tons of waste per year from being sent to landfills and has increased its amount of recycled products by 16 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Schindler Opens New Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Schindler Elevator Corp. recently opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Hanover, Pa., that has earned North America&amp;#39;s first gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green-building certification for an elevator manufacturing plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 150,000-square-foot facility will produce customer-facing components such as doors, entrances, jambs and elevator cab interiors. The plant also includes the company&amp;#39;s order-fulfillment warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We are very excited to be opening this new factory in south-central Pennsylvania where we have had a manufacturing presence for many years,&amp;quot; said Jakob Zueger, Schindler Americas CEO. &amp;quot;We help our customers achieve their green-building and sustainability goals in projects around the world every day, but this facility is another example of how Schindler is truly embracing sustainability in our own business as well.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The LEED rating system, which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), is the foremost program for buildings, homes and communities that are designed, constructed, maintained and operated for improved environmental and human health performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Hanover facility achieved LEED certification for implementing practical and measurable strategies and solutions aimed at achieving high performance in sustainable site development, water conservation, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. The facility will serve as a model for future Schindler production facilities around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The strength of USGBC has always been the collective strength of our leaders in the building industry,&amp;quot; said Rick Fedrizzi, U.S. Green Building Council president and CEO. &amp;quot;Given the extraordinary importance of climate protection and the central role of the building industry in that effort, Schindler demonstrates their leadership through their LEED certification of this new Hanover manufacturing facility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford Reduces Oil and Water Usage with Dry-Machining Technology</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Co. recently announced that it has added dry-machining capability to six of its plants globally and will nearly double that number in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Near-dry machining, also known as minimum quantity lubrication (MQL), is a process that lubricates cutting tools with a fine spray of oil exactly when and where it is needed. In comparison, conventional wet machining floods the part with metalworking fluids, requiring large amounts of fluid to cool and lubricate the tools used to make engines and transmissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For a typical production line, MQL can save more than 280,000 gallons of water per year. The Cologne Engine Plant in Germany decreased water use per engine by 50 percent from 2011 to 2012 by switching to the MQL process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Reducing the environmental footprint of our plants is a critical part of Ford&amp;#39;s overall sustainability commitment,&amp;quot; said Andrew Hobbs, director of Ford&amp;#39;s environmental quality office. &amp;quot;Expanding new processes such as MQL across our global network of facilities allows us to have an even greater impact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	MQL also reduces the amount of oil needed to machine an engine or transmission by 80 percent or more. Without the need for a coolant system across most engine production lines, MQL also helps to reduce energy use. While conventional wet machining produces an airborne mist, MQL eliminates that mist, improving air quality in the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Plants that have switched to the MQL process include the Livonia Transmission Plant in Michigan, the Changan Ford Engine Plant in China, the Romeo Engine Plant in Michigan, the Craiova Engine Plant in Romania, the Cologne Engine Plant in Germany and the Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;MQL technology will also be incorporated into future engine and transmission plants, underscoring our commitment to advanced manufacturing processes that reduce water and resource requirements,&amp;quot; said Bill Russo, director of manufacturing for Ford powertrain operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford continues to work toward cutting water use 30 percent per vehicle by 2015. Between 2000 and 2012, Ford reduced global water use by 62 percent &amp;ndash; about 10 billion gallons.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Volkswagen Plant Earns Engineering Excellence Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Volkswagen assembly plant in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Chattanooga, Tenn., &lt;/span&gt;recently earned one of eight grand awards for engineering excellence at the 47th Annual Engineering Excellence Awards. The award was presented to Volkswagen and SSOE Group representatives at an awards gala in&amp;nbsp;&lt;span itemprop="contentLocation" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Place"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="geo" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/address"&gt;&lt;span itemprop="addressLocality"&gt;Washington D.C&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Sponsored by the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC), the Engineering Excellence Awards are chosen by a panel of judges representing industry, government, academia and media. Projects throughout the world are rated on the basis of uniqueness and innovative applications; future value to the engineering profession; perception by the public; social, economic and sustainable development considerations; complexity; and successful fulfillment of the client&amp;rsquo;s/owner&amp;#39;s needs, including schedule and budget. The panel selects 24 award winners, with 16 honor awards and eight grand awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p itemprop="articleBody"&gt;
	Along with its Engineering Excellence Award, the Volkswagen assembly plant has received a platinum certification from the U.S. Green Building Council&amp;#39;s (USGBC) Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building certification program, becoming the only LEED platinum automotive manufacturing plant in the world, the first LEED platinum industrial campus in the U.S. and the largest platinum project in the U.S. (based on building area).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The facility was built on a 1,350-acre brownfield site and incorporates several innovative methods to lessen its environmental impact. The building is able to save 42 percent of the energy consumed from both the manufacturing process and building facilities. The plant also uses rain water to reduce water usage by 653,000 gallons per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, roller-compacted concrete was chosen in lieu of asphalt in many areas, and a white roof with a high albedo was utilized throughout all buildings in order to minimize the heat-island effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Air-handling equipment was designed with heat-recovery wheels, which allow the reuse of heat energy prior to releasing it into the atmosphere. Skylights ensure natural lighting throughout the facility, reducing the energy demand from light fixtures. LED lighting was selected for the exterior, which uses 68 percent less energy than its predecessors.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Honda Plant to Use Wind Energy</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Juhl Wind Inc. recently announced an agreement with Honda Transmission Manufacturing of America Inc. to develop, install and operate two utility-scale wind turbines that will generate electricity for the plant in Russell&amp;#39;s Point, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Once the turbines begin operating later this year, the Honda Transmission plant will be the first major automotive manufacturing facility in the United States to obtain a substantial amount of its electricity directly from wind turbines located on its property. The turbines, with blades approximately 160 feet long, will be installed on 260-foot towers on the Honda property, which is suited for a maximum of two wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Juhl Wind is supplying full development services along with construction management of the $8-million project, which is scheduled to be completed in 2013. Juhl will also provide ongoing operation of the turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	An evaluation of the project showed that renewable energy from the two wind turbines will supply approximately 10 percent of the plant&amp;#39;s electricity, while also reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. Studies commissioned by Honda Transmission indicated that wind-generated power is a cost-effective source of electricity for the plant, and that the project will not adversely impact local wildlife or the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is just one of many ways that Honda is seeking to reduce our environmental footprint, and we appreciate the experience and knowledge that Juhl Wind is bringing to this unique wind-generation project,&amp;quot; said Honda Transmission vice president Gary Hand. &amp;quot;In our own ways, both Honda and Juhl are committed to reducing carbon-dioxide emissions.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Globally, Honda has established voluntary goals to reduce the environmental impact of its products and manufacturing operations by 2020. This includes a 30-percent reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions from Honda products and significant carbon-dioxide reductions from the company&amp;#39;s plants and other operations, compared with 2000 levels. To achieve these new environmental targets, Honda is accelerating its efforts to advance the environmental performance of its products and operations throughout North America.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>SC Johnson Adds Wind Turbines at Wisconsin Manufacturing Facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	SC Johnson recently added two new wind turbines at its Waxdale manufacturing facility located in Mount Pleasant, Wis., marking another step in the company&amp;#39;s goal of increasing worldwide renewable energy use to 44 percent of total electricity by 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The addition of wind power means that the facility is now able to produce an average of 100 percent of its electrical energy on-site, reducing carbon emissions associated with powering Waxdale by 6,000 metric tons annually. Each 415-foot turbine features a permanent magnet, gearless generator, which requires less maintenance but produces higher energy yields than the more traditional gearbox-type system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;SC Johnson has been making green choices for our products and operations for decades,&amp;quot; said Fisk Johnson, chairman and CEO of SC Johnson. &amp;quot;Waxdale&amp;#39;s new wind turbines enable us to manufacture our products while having an even smaller impact on the environment &amp;ndash; and that&amp;#39;s something the people of SC Johnson are very proud of. The turbines are yet another symbol of our commitment to future generations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Waxdale plant, which is the size of 36 football fields, is SC Johnson&amp;#39;s largest manufacturing facility and home to additional clean energy initiatives. In the mid-2000s, two cogeneration systems were put in place that use waste methane gas from a nearby public landfill and clean-burning natural gas to generate 85 percent of the facility&amp;#39;s electrical energy. The new wind turbines will provide the remaining 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2000, SC Johnson has also worked to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 26 percent. In Bay City, Mich., nearly half of the electricity needed to operate the company&amp;#39;s plant now comes from off-site wind power. SC Johnson currently is researching on-site projects to increase the use of clean energy there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the SC Johnson plant in Medan, Indonesia, waste palm shells are used as a replacement for diesel fuel. It transfers a waste product back into the value chain with minimal impact and has reduced local diesel fuel use by 80 percent. It also cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In May 2012, the company launched a new biofuel initiative at its factory in Surabaya, Indonesia, using waste husks from rice grains as a fuel source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several solar projects are also helping provide hot-water heating for SC Johnson&amp;#39;s facility in Shanghai, China. One provides hot water for food service and other office needs. Solar-heated waste water from the facility&amp;#39;s steam piping network aids aerosol production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to these energy-saving efforts, SC Johnson is also working toward becoming landfill neutral by 2016. Through operational commitments, the company expects to eliminate or divert more than 480 million pounds of waste from the nation&amp;#39;s landfills, which is equivalent to more than its U.S. waste footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A leading manufacturer of household cleaning products and products for home storage, air care and insect control, SC Johnson employs nearly 13,000 people globally and sells products in virtually every country around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Carton Companies Reduce Energy Costs with Efficient Lighting</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Independent Carton Group (ICG) recently announced that its members have collectively saved more than $1.8 million in electricity costs and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 18.1 million pounds annually by implementing energy-efficient lighting solutions in their manufacturing facilities, warehouses and offices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The association of 17 independently owned and operated folding carton companies worked with Efficient Lighting Consultants (ELC) to create a custom energy-efficiency program, which included auditing energy consumption, devising conservation strategies, leveraging energy incentives and employing technologies that provide for the immediate reduction of energy usage while remaining within members&amp;#39; current utility budgets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In addition to considerable environmental and cost-saving benefits, many of our members have told us that the new lighting reflects true colors better and provides for improved color matching,&amp;quot; said Andy Willie, president of the Independent Carton Group. &amp;quot;Since we know our members work closely with color matching in the manufacture of folding cartons, we&amp;#39;ve been very pleased to hear about this ancillary benefit of the program.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The ICG members&amp;#39; collective annual savings of more than $1.8 million is the result of more than 16.4 million kilowatt hours of electricity being saved each year.&amp;nbsp;This is equivalent to more than 8.4 million pounds of coal and nearly 1.1 million gallons of oil not burned, or the amount of fossil fuels needed to provide 1,976 homes with electricity for one year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	ICG members have also helped reduce air pollution and improve air quality by decreasing their greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful environmental pollutants.&amp;nbsp;Gas emissions avoided annually include 33,383 pounds of sulfur oxides, 8,906 pounds of nitrogen oxides and more than 18 million pounds of carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Achieving Total Productive Maintenance without Supervisors </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Several years ago I visited a state-of-the-art power plant that had a net generation of 260 megawatts, which is enough electricity to serve 75,000 homes. I was there for an executive meeting of the Society for Maintenance and Reliability Professionals, which included presentations about this unique plant and its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It was a green plant in more ways than one. The technology was designed with &amp;ldquo;green&amp;rdquo; in mind, and it was a new plant with all of the potential that comes with that. The result was a world-class example of total productive maintenance (TPM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The opportunity with the most risk was the marriage of maintenance and operations. This was to be a very intense front-end workload with major operating cost impacts. For example, there were 55 craftsmen comprising five 11-person supervisor-less teams on rotating shifts, with the rotated-out team devoted to planning and project type work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The unique part was that all were experienced craftsmen in performing the required maintenance activities as well as plant operations. There were two managers: a plant manager and a maintenance manager. Every three weeks, corresponding to the shift rotation, they traded places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During the process of planning for the plant and its operation, management decided to do away with supervisors, planners, maintenance engineers and schedulers. Could not the maintenance/operators perform these activities? Well, yes, if it was laid out and appropriate training was provided to all concerned. It was decided that all of the functions of a world-class operation would be present and active, however resident within each team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were approximately 20 people interviewed for each position. Most unsuccessful applicants were uncertain about self-directed teams. After the first employees were selected, they and following hires would make up the interviewing teams. The position requirements included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The employee was a journeyman in a technical craft&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Had a willingness to work in a team-empowered environment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be cross-trained to be multi-skilled&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be trained on and support world-class maintenance principles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be trained and willing to operate the plant equipment&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Be willing to do whatever the shift required in concert with the other 10 team members.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Work-order planning and within-shift scheduling would come from within the team. Training coincided with the plant construction, taking advantage of the contractors and equipment vendors participating in installations, while simultaneously developing preventive, predictive and corrective maintenance procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Extensive training also covered the soft skills required for self-managed work teams and working in this open environment. All administrative, planning and estimating, preventive and overhaul, operating, performance evaluation, stockroom, and maintenance engineering procedures were developed by the team members with guidance from the two managers, the plant technical staff and company employees from other plants. The 55 craftsmen owned the operation of this generating facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A computerized maintenance management system (CMMS) was specified by the teams, and world-class estimating, planning and scheduling were loaded into the system. Preventive maintenance (PM) tasks were assigned to the four shifts, and the rotating teams did not change this basic schedule unless it was agreed across teams. Each team developed expertise within itself for estimating and planning work orders along with analysis of maintenance and operational performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Every three weeks, a member from each team would be chosen within the team as a shift representative through whom the other shifts communicated, and the managers would convey pertinent information. After a year, the two managers thought that maybe the representatives should be paid extra for this three-week term. To a man, the 55 craftsmen decided that management should take that additional money and divide it up to increase the hourly rate for all. &amp;quot;This is a team effort.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the two years the plant had been in operation, team members all attended additional outside training, some began college programs, and all participated in continuous evaluations of the preventive and predictive maintenance activities. The result was that the plant continued to see continuous improvement, proving that implementation of TPM is possible even without supervisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/ZT0mGz49NgA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SeaPak Plant Earns BAP Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Rich Products Corporation&amp;#39;s Brownsville manufacturing plant recently earned &amp;quot;Best Aquaculture Practices&amp;quot; (BAP) certification by the Global Aquaculture Alliance (GAA). The Brownsville plant produces a large majority of Rich&amp;#39;s seafood products distributed by SeaPak Shrimp and Seafood Co. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The BAP certification standards were developed by the GAA, a nonprofit, nongovernmental organization that encourages the use of responsible aquaculture practices. The BAP certification program is voluntary for aquaculture facilities, and the BAP standards for seafood processing plants are among the most comprehensive certification systems. SeaPak&amp;#39;s Brownsville plant achieved BAP certification to process shrimp and tilapia, which are the aquaculture products handled at the facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Our Brownsville plant produces 85 percent of our seafood items, so we take great pride in this certification,&amp;quot; said Eddie De La Rosa, plant manager at the Brownsville manufacturing facility. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s wonderful to be recognized by the seafood industry&amp;#39;s leading aquaculture certification program for the things we do to provide safe, high-quality seafood.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The BAP certification standards define the most important elements of responsible aquaculture and provide quantitative guidelines for evaluating adherence to those practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Compliance with BAP standards requires program participants to comprehensively address environmental and social responsibility, as well as animal welfare, food safety and traceability throughout their operations,&amp;quot; said BAP vice president of development Peter Redmond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1948, SeaPak has used strict quality, sourcing and sustainability standards for its products, including a commitment to source only from suppliers whose practices limit negative environmental impact.

            <title>Reliability is a Green Initiative</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Demand for products has declined in many parts of the world, and with more manufacturing being shipped overseas, reliability of our existing processes is even more important than before. Many of my friends in different industries have told me about all of the initiatives being done to &amp;ldquo;green up&amp;rdquo; their facilities and processes. Going green and being environmentally responsible is a great thing, and I think we should be pushing to move more in that direction. With that said, the interesting thing that I have been hearing is that reliability is getting lost in the green push.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I think reliability is the first green initiative we should invest in. Some people will argue that reliability is not a green initiative, but I assure you that it is. It&amp;rsquo;s no mystery that part of being green is doing more with less. Improved reliability will mean a decrease in demand of raw materials and storage space for those materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A benefit in decreased use of raw materials means longer-term sustainability of the raw materials. This will also make it easier to project needs of materials because the process will be more stable and predictable. The decreased amount of raw materials may increase the cost per unit, but it usually will be far offset by the second part of reliability being a green initiative, which is a decrease in waste materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The decrease in waste materials will have a huge impact on cost and safety. Not only does the decrease in waste materials mean a reduction in disposal but also decreased cost in storage of the waste materials. In addition, the decreased amount of especially hazardous waste reduces the risk of environmental or safety incidents occurring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I am not in any way saying that we need to set the green initiatives aside. What I am saying is that reliability should take the front seat and not get put behind green. Reliability is a green initiative in itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/Nt0heiNV3_M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Monmouth Upgrades New Jersey Plant with Green Manufacturing Practices</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Monmouth Rubber and Plastics recently completed a major expansion and upgrade at its Long Branch, N.J., plant with energy-saving measures to improve productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The maker of neoprene sponge and foam as well as other closed-cell rubber and plastic materials expects the efficiency improvements to benefit its customers through increased product quality and lower production costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The expansion includes a new equipment line, consisting of state-of-the-art mixers and presses, along with data monitoring of all processes. New electrical lighting throughout the facility should lower the company&amp;rsquo;s electric bills while improving visibility throughout the plant, which the company anticipates will increase worker morale and, subsequently, efficiency and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Monmouth is going state-of-the-art with efficiency on a global scale,&amp;rdquo; said company founder and general manager John M. Bonforte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company undertook the project with assistance from the New Jersey Clean Energy Program, which offers financial incentives for commercial, industrial and government customers to integrate energy efficient and renewable technologies into new construction and upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The neoprene foam manufacturer also enrolled in an emergency demand response program, in which Monmouth Rubber and Plastics agreed to reduce its electric power consumption on demand during critical periods to help avoid local and regional power outages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our participation in this program contributes to the overall protection of the power grid and helps avoid additional utility costs and lost revenues for all consumers and businesses in our community,&amp;rdquo; Bonforte said.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Goodyear to Receive Award for Zero Waste to Landfill Program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Goodyear Tire &amp;amp; Rubber Company will receive a 2012 Manny Award in the &amp;quot;Green Initiative&amp;quot; category from &lt;em&gt;Inside Business&lt;/em&gt; magazine. The award is in recognition of Goodyear&amp;#39;s zero waste to landfill program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Goodyear will receive the award at a banquet in Cleveland on May 17 and will be featured in the May/June issue of &lt;em&gt;Inside Business&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 2008, Goodyear has not sent any manufacturing waste from its 53 factories to landfills anywhere in the world. The initiative was started in 2006 to reduce Goodyear&amp;#39;s environmental impact by requiring all plants to reduce, reuse and recycle manufacturing waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Goodyear believes our zero waste to landfill initiative represents a responsible next step in environmental stewardship, both through the effective management of byproducts and also the elimination of materials going into landfills,&amp;quot; said Dave Chapman, Goodyear&amp;#39;s director of environmental, health and safety sustainability. &amp;quot;As part of our corporate mission, we strive to take care of our environment and communities, and achieving zero waste to landfill is a win for both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the 2012 Manny Award for zero waste to landfill, Goodyear received a 2011 Manny Award in the &amp;ldquo;Employee Safety&amp;rdquo; category for its &amp;ldquo;No One Gets Hurt&amp;rdquo; internal safety strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the past 15 years, the Manny Awards have recognized Northeast Ohio manufacturers&amp;#39; greatest accomplishments, innovation and best practices. Since 1998, the Manny Awards program has recognized more than 100 manufacturers that have excelled in such areas as product development, green initiatives and workplace environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One of the world&amp;#39;s largest tire companies, Goodyear employs approximately 73,000 people and manufactures its products in 53 facilities in 22 countries around the world.

            <title>Holcim Plants Receive Safety, Environmental Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim Inc. recently announced that its plants in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Holly Hill, S.C.,&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Theodore, Ala.&lt;/span&gt;, were recognized for their safety and environmental performance during the Portland Cement Association&amp;#39;s (PCA) spring board of directors&amp;rsquo; meeting in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Chicago&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Holly Hill&lt;/span&gt; plant received the Chairman&amp;#39;s Safety Performance Award in recognition of its exceptional health and safety programs, while the &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Theodore&lt;/span&gt; plant earned the Environmental Performance Award for steps taken beyond those required by laws, regulations and permits to minimize their impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Safety and the environment are of utmost importance to Holcim,&amp;quot; said Bernard Terver, president and chief executive officer of Holcim. &amp;quot;This recognition is a reflection of our employees&amp;#39; commitment to making sure that each of our employees and visitors to our facilities go home safely at the end of the day, and of their commitment to protecting the environment. They have worked hard to produce these results and are deserving of these awards.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Holcim is one of the nation&amp;#39;s leading manufacturers and suppliers of cement and mineral components with approximately 1,800 employees, 12 manufacturing plants and more than 50 distribution facilities in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt;.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/4/12/ce91ff8e-8cf7-4f63-b1ac-e8f073bf6876_whirlpool.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left;" /&gt;Whirlpool Corporation recently opened its new manufacturing facility in Cleveland, Tenn., for production of premium cooking products. The $200-million project includes a state-of-the-art production facility and distribution center and will be the largest premium cooking plant in the world. Whirlpool expects the project will add about 130 new jobs to its existing Cleveland workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 3.75pt;"&gt;
	The new 1-million-square-foot production facility includes many energy efficient and technologically advanced manufacturing processes and is expected to obtain LEED Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. The new facility is replacing a 123-year-old plant a few miles away. The full transition to the new facility is expected to be complete by mid-2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left: 3.75pt;"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The advanced production here supports the growth of our premium cooking products business, which includes some of the most innovative ranges, ovens and cooktops offered in the marketplace,&amp;rdquo; said Jeff Fettig, chairman and chief executive officer for Whirlpool Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Cascades to Close Toronto Plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cascades Inc. recently announced the permanent closure of its Enviropac plant in Toronto. Production at the facility, which specialized in the manufacturing of Technicomb honeycomb packaging intended primarily for the furniture packaging industry, will be redirected toward the Cascades Enviropac plants in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Berthierville, Qu&amp;eacute;bec. Approximately 36 employees will be affected by this closure, which will be effective on June 1, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The decision to cease operations at the Toronto plant is due to a significant reduction in business volume,&amp;rdquo; stated Luc Langevin, president and chief operating officer of Cascades Specialty Products Group. &amp;ldquo;This decision was taken to secure the group&amp;#39;s profitability and to improve its position as leader in the industrial packaging sector. Demand in the honeycomb packaging industry has been affected by challenging economic conditions over the past few years, and it is imperative we adjust our operations based on this new economic environment. This initiative will enable us to maximize the operations at our mills of Grand Rapids and Berthierville while continuing to offer a first-class product and service to our customers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cascades will help employees affected by this closure to relocate to other manufacturing plants and provide them with assistance in their search for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Founded in 1964, Cascades produces, converts and markets packaging and tissue products that are composed mainly of recycled fibers. The company employs approximately 11,000 employees who work in more than 100 facilities located in North America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Georgia-Pacific Receives Performance Awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2012/2/16/73a6a77f-00f5-49c1-809d-37ac2ac30fa6_Grainger PIP Awards for GP.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 187px; float: left;" /&gt;For the second year in a row, Georgia-Pacific Professional has received two Partners in Performance Awards at Grainger&amp;rsquo;s annual supplier conference held recently in Rosemont, Ill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Georgia-Pacific Professional earned both the &amp;ldquo;Green Supplier of the Year&amp;rdquo; and an award for supplier excellence for 2011. This is the fifth year in a row that Grainger has recognized Georgia-Pacific with a supplier excellence award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a leading distributor of facilities maintenance supplies, Grainger presents awards annually to a select group of suppliers for outstanding performance throughout the year.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	Grainger&amp;#39;s Partners in Performance Awards recognize suppliers who achieve excellence in several categories, including responsiveness, information integrity, on-time shipping and variability, management commitment and order fulfillment. Grainger suppliers receive ratings throughout the year for their performance in each of these categories. Out of Grainger&amp;#39;s 3,000 suppliers, less than 1 percent are chosen to receive these annual awards.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grainger is proud to recognize Georgia-Pacific Professional for its outstanding supplier performance,&amp;quot; said Fred Costello, Grainger vice president of product management. &amp;ldquo;Grainger provides customers access to all of the products they need to keep their facilities safe, clean and functioning, and our suppliers are a critical part of that focus. We appreciate Georgia-Pacific Professional&amp;rsquo;s commitment to providing superior service and environmentally preferable products.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Grainger is a valued customer for us, and we are excited that they continue to recognize the work that we do in the areas of sustainability and supplier excellence,&amp;rdquo; said Scott Light, president of Georgia-Pacific Professional. &amp;ldquo;The Green Supplier award especially highlights our ongoing commitment to building environmental, social and economic sustainability into our products and processes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>AOC Earns LEED Silver Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AOC LLC has earned LEED Silver certification from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) for the design, construction and operation of its world headquarters in Collierville, Tenn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	LEED certification is an internationally recognized standard for green building. Factors like site sustainability, water and energy efficiency, materials, waste management, indoor environmental quality and design innovation earn points for a LEED candidate during evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AOC&amp;#39;s LEED Silver qualifications include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A geothermal HVAC system&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Building materials with recycled or renewable content&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Regionally produced construction materials and certified wood&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Pollution prevention during construction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Low-emitting sealants, paints and construction materials&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A reflective roof which eliminates heat buildup&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Maximum use of ambient lighting&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increased ventilation and outdoor air delivery monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Light pollution reduction&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Recycling facilities&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Water-saving systems&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Incentives for employees to use low-emitting vehicles and bicycles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a result of these building tactics, the company&amp;#39;s new headquarters can conserve 30 percent more energy and water than similar non-LEED buildings, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and landfill waste, and require lower operating costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;AOC&amp;rsquo;s LEED silver certification demonstrates tremendous green building leadership,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Fedrizzi, USBGC president, CEO and founding chair. &amp;ldquo;The urgency of USGBC&amp;rsquo;s mission has challenged the industry to move faster and reach further. AOC serves as a prime example of just how much we can accomplish.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;From inception, we wanted our global headquarters to reflect our continuous commitment to the environment,&amp;rdquo; said Randy Weghorst, AOC chairman and CEO. &amp;ldquo;Sustainability is a critical corporate objective and is reflected in our headquarters, products and manufacturing facilities. And to help customers meet sustainability goals, we continue to grow our EcoTek product line of bio-renewable content, recycled content and/or styrene-free materials.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification was verified by the Green Building Verification Institute, a third-party organization that provides independent oversight of green building programs in the United States.

            <title>Tremco Wins 5 Excellence in Design Awards </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Tremco Roofing and Building Maintenance recently announced that it has won five 2011 RoofPoint Excellence in Design Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The RoofPoint program from the Center for Environmental Innovation in Roofing (Center) is a voluntary, consensus-based green rating system developed to help building owners and designers select non-residential roof systems based on long-term energy and environmental benefits. The Excellence in Design Awards were established as a way to recognize exceptional projects that meet RoofPoint&amp;rsquo;s mission and criteria. In the inaugural year for the awards, there were 10 categories, and more than 40 entries were submitted. Tremco projects won awards in four categories, as well as an honorable mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the excellence in life cycle management category, Tremco earned the award for efficient re-use of original roofing materials at the Sam Nunn Federal Center in Atlanta, Ga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tremco&amp;rsquo;s winning entry in the excellence in innovation category was for its work at the College of Marin Fine Arts Building in Kentfield, Calif., which incorporated a green roof with native, drought-tolerant vegetation and a high R-value insulation system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the advancing sustainable roofing category, the company was honored for its renovation at the Tremco Incorporated headquarters in Beachwood, Ohio, with four sustainable roofing systems including a 9,000-square-foot vegetated roof with almost 16,000 plants and 46 species, a white reflective TPA membrane, an all-white built-up system with white gravel set in a white adhesive, and two rooftop photovoltaic installations for renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tremco&amp;rsquo;s award in the public sector leadership category was for projects installed on schools and municipal structures encompassing photovoltaic and vegetated integrated systems, learning stations, renovated historical structures and a Native American artifacts museum utilizing advanced day lighting and harvesting ceremonial natural vegetation from the construction site that was replanted on the vegetated roofing system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company also received an honorable mention in the global leadership category for projects such as a roof restoration using 1,000-year-old technologies at a Viking ship-rebuilding site in Newfoundland and Labrador, an LEED platinum new school in Ontario, and a corporate complex for a provincial utility (hydro-electric) in Manitoba that utilized active and passive heating combined with a highly insulated vegetated roof for energy conservation and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We want to congratulate everyone involved in these projects &amp;ndash; our customers, professional clients, sales representatives, WTI associates and contractors,&amp;quot; said Paul Mitchell, administrator of strategic initiatives and alliances for Tremco. &amp;quot;While the awards are a wonderful acknowledgement of their efforts, they are only possible because of the market&amp;rsquo;s growing understanding of the importance of sustainable building practices.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Center for Environmental Innovation in Roofing is a non-profit organization headquartered in Washington, D.C., whose mission is to promote the development and use of environmentally responsible, high-performance roof systems and technologies.

            <title>Nice-Pak/PDI Converts Manufacturing Plant to âZero Landfillâ</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nice-Pak/PDI has announced the transformation of its Orangeburg, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;N.Y.,&lt;/span&gt; manufacturing plant into a &amp;quot;zero landfill&amp;quot; facility. The wet-wipe manufacturing plant now sends more than 2,000 tons of non-recyclable waste per year to a waste-to-energy facility in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Peekskill, N.Y.&lt;/span&gt;, where it provides fuel for electricity generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Over the past several years, we have worked hard to maximize our in-plant recycling rate,&amp;quot; said Adam Lurie, vice president of operations at &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Orangeburg&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;quot;Now we are using the small percentage of waste that is non-recyclable to produce cleaner electricity. Every year, this eliminates approximately 250,000 cubic feet of landfill, replaces 10 railcars of coal that would otherwise be burned to generate that same electricity and reduces greenhouse gas production by 1,967 metric tons of CO2-e (carbon-dioxide equivalent). That&amp;#39;s like removing 380 passenger cars from the road, according to EPA figures.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nice-Pak/PDI has already exceeded its goal of a 50-percent reduction in total solid waste to landfill in three years. As a result of the company&amp;#39;s ongoing war on waste, three of four U.S. manufacturing facilities recycle all cardboard boxes, barrels and shrink wrap, and send the balance of materials to local waste-to-energy facilities. The company&amp;#39;s fourth U.S. manufacturing facility will be converted to &amp;quot;zero landfill&amp;quot; in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We have an opportunity to make a significant difference through environmentally responsible actions and to help educate families and communities about the important role they can have in protecting our environment,&amp;quot; said Robert Julius, Nice-Pak/PDI chairman and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sustainability at Nice-Pak/PDI extends beyond waste management. The company&amp;#39;s long-term sustainability strategy addresses energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, materials efficiency, components, chemistry, water impact and community education. As a step toward harmonizing company-wide activity, the company launched a strategic plan in &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;January 2011&lt;/span&gt; to coordinate sustainability initiatives at its individual facilities.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/12/2/a6fecd31-bb6e-450f-9b1b-4800eb0b1162_toyota indiana award.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 167px; float: left;" /&gt;Toyota recently announced that its Columbus, Ind., manufacturing plant, Toyota Industrial Equipment Mfg., Inc. (TIEM), was awarded the Indiana Governor&amp;rsquo;s Award for Environmental Excellence in the &amp;ldquo;Five Years of Continuous Improvement&amp;rdquo; category. This marks the third time the award has been bestowed on TIEM for implementing exemplary environmental projects with measurable results.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;By seeking out and utilizing innovative environment practices, TIEM has reduced waste, saved money and contributed greatly to Indiana&amp;rsquo;s environmental protection efforts, benefiting the health and welfare of the state&amp;rsquo;s communities,&amp;rdquo; said Indiana Department of Environmental Management commissioner Thomas Easterly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of TIEM&amp;rsquo;s management principles is to be a good corporate citizen,&amp;rdquo; said Toshiya Yamagishi, president of TIEM. &amp;ldquo;We are proud of our associates&amp;rsquo; commitment to environmental programs and practices that support our community.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TIEM&amp;rsquo;s Environmental Management Program has made significant improvements in plant operations. Some of the environmentally friendly changes that have been made include reformulating paints and using solvents, improving transfer efficiencies, improving maintenance of and annually calibrating water-flow monitors on high-water usage equipment, and reducing and more closely monitoring watering of lawns.

            <title>Frito-Lay Facility Earns LEED Gold Certification</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2011/11/28/f118263c-7baa-4ddc-b455-c61a4f64868d_image.jpeg" style="margin: 7px; width: 250px; height: 166px; float: left;" /&gt;Frito-Lay&amp;#39;s new distribution facility in Oahu, Hawaii, has earned the U.S. Green Building Council&amp;rsquo;s LEED gold certification. The 55,000-square-foot design is Hawaii&amp;#39;s first industrial &amp;quot;new construction&amp;quot; gold site. LEED certification is awarded from the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and verified by the Green Building Certification Institute (GBCI). LEED is a nationwide program for the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Frito-Lay&amp;rsquo;s building design incorporated LEED requirements such as energy-efficient construction. Some features of the building and construction include an energy-management system to control facility equipment, photovoltaics to generate 10 percent of the facility&amp;#39;s electricity, parking on the roof to reduce the amount of site being paved, energy-efficient windows and skylights to provide ample daylight, light-colored paved surfaces to reduce the heat-island effect, and reserved parking for carpools and energy-efficient vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Materials were selected for recycle content, regional manufacture or low levels of volatile organic compounds. Water use was reduced by installing low-flow plumbing fixtures. Low-maintenance native plants were incorporated into the landscaping design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The design build and general contractor for the distribution center was the Haskell Company.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>First Oil Reprocessing Plant in New England Almost Complete</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	ROLLINSFORD, N.H. &amp;mdash; Construction at Green View Technologies is about 80 percent complete and owners are excited their dream of creating New England&amp;#39;s first oil reprocessing facility has almost come to fruition.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View President Mark Wentworth, whose family owns Wentworth Greenhouses, said the state-of-the-art plant on Green View Drive will likely be completed in mid-to-late summer, something he and others involved in the project are eagerly awaiting.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;We think it&amp;#39;s going be good for the environment and reduce the amount of used motor oil put back into it by reblending it back into new oil,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;It should be a big benefit for the area. There are no other facilities like it. The technology&amp;#39;s fairly new, and it should become very popular as environmental concerns become greater over new oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The facility received local and state approval late last year. It is designed to clean used oil to be reused in commercial lubrication purposes, and Wentworth said his company plans to sell the cleaned oil to other companies to reblend it for a variety of retail purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said the facility adds 28 new jobs to the town and has the capacity to produce several million gallons of product a year. That total includes the byproducts of the process: distillate fuel, which is heavy-metal free and will be used to run the plant as well as sold to other businesses, such as Wentworth Greenhouses; and an asphalt product that can be used for roads and roof materials.&lt;br /&gt;
	Wentworth said only about 2 percent of the product volume is unusable, as wastewater is generated by the process, while roughly 75 percent of the total product volume will be reprocessed oil, about 15 percent is fuel and the remainder is asphalt.&lt;br /&gt;
	He said this efficiency, as well as the cleaner oils, will help reduce emissions because Green View isn&amp;#39;t disposing of used oil or waste in an incinerator, as well as the fact the fuel generated by the process is cleaner and will help companies using it reduce their emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;Once oil is burned, the resource is gone forever,&amp;quot; said Wentworth. &amp;quot;Our process recovers that resource and we&amp;#39;re able to use it over and over again, basically forever, so it&amp;#39;s a good thing for the environment and energy conservation because it takes less energy to reprocess old oil than to refine new crude oil.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	Aside from concerns about odors from the plant, which Wentworth has said they have mitigated through the design process, town officials have also expressed satisfaction about bringing the facility to Rollinsford because it will help boost the tax base and bolster the local economy.&lt;br /&gt;
	Warren Daniel, the regional manager of the state&amp;#39;s Small Business Development Center, also said he thinks the plant will be a notable addition to the area.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;quot;I think that the plant is going to be a tremendous job creator,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s the kind of company we need in New Hampshire regarding sustainability and regarding bringing energy production to this country.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Small Business Development Center as well as the Southeast Economic Development Corporation assisted Green View in developing a business plan and secure financing for the project, the cost of which Wentworth declined to disclose.&lt;br /&gt;
	Green View financed part of the project through two different loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration, as well as through a $480,000 loan through the community development block grant program.&lt;br /&gt;
	The block grant, loaned to Green View through the SEDC after the state and town approved the use of the grant, is the first-ever for Rollinsford, according to SEDC Executive Director Dennis McCann.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said that milestone is important because he said the facility could not have been built without the block grant, which is a federal program that funds projects that, among other things, benefit low-income circumstances and/or work toward the betterment of the community.&lt;br /&gt;
	McCann said he was grateful to have been a part of the process, and said he is looking forward to &amp;quot;celebrating&amp;quot; the end of the construction with Wentworth because Green View has been in the works for about 2 1/2 years.&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s been a while,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re pretty excited to participate in New England&amp;#39;s first recycling plant for lubricating oil, especially when other areas of the country (and world) have these facilities and we don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/GTSL0cJGWfg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

	&lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;WICHITA, Kan.&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;April 6, 2011&lt;/span&gt; /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Lubricants, America&amp;#39;s only true closed loop oil recycling company, today announced that &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt; on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair company Equipment Savers has hired them to recycle tens of thousands of used oil filters and approximately 55,000 gallons of used oil each year. The recovered oil from the filters and the used oil will be re-refined at the company&amp;#39;s advanced refinery in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt; to make its American Petroleum Institute (API) certified green motor&amp;mdash;ECO ULTRA&amp;reg;. The scrap steel from the oil filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products ensuring that nothing ends up in a landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; tightly controlled closed loop oil recycling process gives us the piece of mind and confidence that our used oil filters and oil will be properly recycled,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Tom Sullivan&lt;/span&gt;, Service Manager at Equipment Savers Fleet Services. &amp;quot;For over two decades, Equipment Savers has been providing safe and environmentally responsible on-site fueling, preventive maintenance and repair services in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Colorado&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Arizona&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Texas&lt;/span&gt; and our relationship with Universal Lubricants furthers that corporate commitment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. produces approximately 1.3 billion gallons of used oil each year, and only 10% of it is re-refined. &amp;nbsp;The rest of the used oil is either improperly disposed of (damaging the environment) or burned as an industrial fuel and is gone forever. Additionally, over 400 million oil filters are used in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt; every year, containing 22 million gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;Unfortunately, many of those filters end up landfills and the oil that they contain contaminates the environment and is gone forever. Universal Lubricants is working to reverse these trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Universal Lubricants is dedicated to protecting the environment and conserving our natural resources&amp;mdash;each week we collect and recycle 150,000 used oil filters reclaiming thousands of gallons of used oil. &amp;nbsp;That reclaimed oil as well as the used oil will collect from around the country is re-refined back to high quality base stock oil and then blended to make our high performance, green ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; motor oil,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;John Wesley&lt;/span&gt;, Chief Executive Officer of Universal Lubricants. &amp;quot;We appreciate Equipment Savers commitment to making a difference.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants collects used oil filters and oil from the government and private businesses such as repair centers, auto parts stores, dealerships, service stations, and oil change centers across &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;the United States&lt;/span&gt;. The company then transports those oil filters to its oil recovery center in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Wichita, Kansas&lt;/span&gt;. The oil recovered is put into the company&amp;#39;s technologically advanced re-refinery where it undergoes a state-of-the-art hydro-treating process to remove all of the water, fuel and solvents as well as metals, asphalt flux and other heavy contaminants. The purified high quality Grade II base stock oil is then blended with a synthetic formula and additives to make API certified ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products. The scrap steel from the filters is sent to a steel mill to be melted and used to produce new products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Universal Lubricants operates 28 facilities in 14 states, including a branch in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Denver, Colorado&lt;/span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;For more information about Universal Lubricants&amp;#39; ECO ULTRA&amp;reg; products and used oil and filter collection services, visit &lt;a href="http://www.universallubes.com" s_oid="http://www.universallubes.com/" s_oidt="0" target="_blank"&gt;www.universallubes.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/ljAX_tXIEU8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>EPA announces next steps on emissions standards for boilers, Incinerators</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On January 20, a federal District Court judge in Washington, D.C., issued an order extending by 30 days the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;rsquo;s deadline to issue emission standards for large and small boilers and solid waste and sewage sludge incinerators. EPA is disappointed that the extension was not longer. However, the agency will work diligently to issue these standards by this new deadline.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The standards will be significantly different than what EPA proposed in April 2010. The agency believes these changes still deserve further public review and comment and expects to solicit further comment through a reconsideration of the rules. Through the reconsideration process, EPA intends to ensure that the rules will be practical to implement and will protect all Americans from dangerous pollutants such as mercury and soot, which can damage children&amp;rsquo;s developing brains, aggravate asthma and cause heart attacks. The agency is considering all other options for addressing these issues before the rules would become effective 60 days after publication in the Federal Register.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA received more than 4,800 comments and additional data during the public comment period for these rules. This information shed new light on a number of key areas, including the scope and coverage of the rules and the way to categorize the various boiler types. Given the extensive comments, EPA filed a motion with the court asking for more time to fully evaluate all the comments and data and finalize the rules.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Thatcher Chemical to pay penalty and reduce air emissions</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency conducted compliance inspections of Thatcher Chemical&amp;rsquo;s Salt Lake City facility in February and April of 2010 to assess compliance with federal risk management program regulations. The settlement requires Thatcher to implement improved maintenance and internal auditing of equipment used to store and process hazardous chemicals, as well as improving documentation of training for employees working with these chemicals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under the Clean Air Act, operations such as Thatcher&amp;rsquo;s must develop a risk management program and submit a risk management plan to assist with emergency preparedness, chemical release prevention, and minimization of releases that occur. EPA Inspectors found that the facility had not adequately implemented those regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Companies that use chemicals and substances which pose a potential danger are responsible for having a robust risk management program in place,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Gaydosh, director of EPA&amp;rsquo;s enforcement program in Denver. &amp;ldquo;Failure to do so places the environment, employees, and the nearby community at risk.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thatcher, which has operations in several states, is subject to the risk management regulations because it stores large quantities of substances classified as &amp;ldquo;extremely hazardous&amp;rdquo; by EPA at its Salt Lake City plant including ammonia, chlorine, and sulfur dioxide. Failure to establish adequate programs and keep plans updated can increase the risk of accidents and reduce preparedness for emergencies.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Nissan obtains integrated ISO14001 certification for all main facilities in Japan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company Ltd. on January 20 announced that it had received integrated ISO14001 certification, an international standard for environmental management systems, for the company&amp;#39;s global headquarters and all of its main facilities in Japan covering the areas of research and development, production, distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December 2006, Nissan set objectives to bolster its environmental management through Nissan Green Program 2010, the company&amp;#39;s mid-term environmental action plan. Having already previously obtained the certification for its five production plants, Nissan Zama Operation Center, Nissan Technical Center (NTC), Nissan Advanced Technology Center (NATC), Nissan Research Center and its product/development processes, the company has now achieved a consistent environmental management, as additional certification was obtained at its new global headquarters, Honmoku Wharf, Customer Service Centers, Global Information System Center, Sagamihara Parts Center, Nissan Education Center and Hokkaido Rikubetsu Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This integrated environmental management has also been applied to Nissan Forklift Corporation and Automotive Energy Supply Corporation, which are affiliates or partner companies of Nissan. As a result, a combined workforce of more than 30,000 people is working on environmental activities with a higher consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In particular, the global headquarters (opened in August 2009), has already obtained the Comprehensive Assessment System for Built Environment Efficiency (CASBEE)&amp;#39;s highest ranking (Class S) in October 2009, in addition to proactively promoting the efficient utilization of natural energy. Today&amp;#39;s announcement proves that the Global Headquarters achieved the establishment of environmental management in all domains-buildings, working processes and business activities in roughly just one year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan will continue activities to strengthen its environmental management, as well as providing models to the market with high environmental performance, &amp;quot;Zero Emission&amp;quot; with its focus on 100 percent electric vehicles and &amp;quot;PURE DRIVE&amp;quot; that are designed to achieve class-leading fuel economy with next-generation eco-technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/CyABAsspQK0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Energy projects transform trash to green power</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized six landfill methane capture projects and partners for their innovation in generating renewable energy and protecting the climate and people&amp;rsquo;s health by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. EPA has assisted with more than 490 landfill gas energy projects over the past 16 years, transforming waste into a green community asset. Landfill gas electricity generation projects have a capacity of 1,680 megawatts (MW) and provide the energy equivalent of powering more than 994,000 homes annually as a clean energy source. The United States currently has approximately 540 operational landfill gas energy projects.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The six winners, announced at the 14th annual Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) conference in Baltimore, include a project that powers manufacturing at a green business park in Indiana and a 10 megawatt combined cycle power plant in Ohio. These projects will contribute to job creation and provide energy savings and green power generation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Methane, a primary component of landfill gas, is a GHG with more than 20 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide. Using landfill gas has several benefits: it provides a significant energy resource, prevents GHG emissions, and reduces odors and other hazards associated with emissions.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This year&amp;#39;s winning projects will avoid the emissions of 165,600 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. This reduction is equivalent to the annual GHG emissions from more than 31,600 passenger vehicles or the carbon dioxide emissions from 385,200 barrels of oil consumed. The direct-use projects will use 830 standard cubic feet per minute and the electricity-generating projects total 13.3 megawatts of generation capacity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Awardees are Montgomery Regional Solid Waste Authority Small Engine Project, Christiansburg, Va.; Frederick County Electricity Project, Winchester, Va.; Crow Wing County Small On-site LFG Boiler Project, Brainerd, Minn.; Hoffman Road LFG and Bay View WWTP Digester Gas 10-MW Project, Toledo, Ohio; and Newton County Renewable Energy Park LFG Direct-Use Project, Brook, Ind. The community partner of the year is Escambia County, Pensacola, Fla.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA&amp;rsquo;s LMOP is a voluntary assistance and partnership program that reduces GHG emissions by supporting landfill gas energy project development. The program also assists countries throughout the world in developing landfill methane reduction projects through the international Global Methane Initiative.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>EPA, Chrysler to take latest hybrid technology from lab to street</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa P. Jackson and Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne on January 19 traveled to Ann Arbor, Mich., to announce a cooperative agreement to develop and adapt hydraulic hybrid technology for the light duty auto market. The goal of this partnership is to design a Chrysler minivan as a demonstration vehicle, using EPA&amp;rsquo;s own patented technology. It is anticipated that the hydraulic hybrid technology will increase overall fuel efficiency 30-35 percent &amp;ndash; 60 percent city driving -- and reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent. Increasing efficiency also cuts down on emissions of other harmful pollutants that threaten Americans&amp;rsquo; health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hydraulic hybrid vehicles represent the cutting edge of fuel-efficiency technology and are one of many approaches we&amp;rsquo;re taking to save money for drivers, clean up the air we breathe and cut the greenhouse gases that jeopardize our health and prosperity,&amp;rdquo; Jackson said. &amp;ldquo;The EPA and Chrysler are working together to explore the possibilities for making this technology affordable and accessible to drivers everywhere. This partnership is further proof that we can preserve our climate, protect our health and strengthen our economy all at the same time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In addition to creating the jobs of the future, clean energy benefits the U.S. economy by ultimately making energy costs more affordable for consumers &amp;ndash; especially if their dollars stay in America,&amp;rdquo; Marchionne said. &amp;ldquo;Hydraulic hybrid vehicle technology is one more promising path worth pursuing in the effort to reduce our carbon footprint, and we are excited to partner with the EPA to push forward on this track.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA&amp;rsquo;s hydraulic hybrid technology, developed in the agency&amp;rsquo;s lab in Ann Arbor is coming into use in large delivery and refuse trucks across the country. The hydraulic hybrid system captures and reuses the energy lost in braking through a hydraulic pressure vessel. The system can also turn off the engine when it is not needed and only fully use the engine when it can operate at peak efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The new partnership seeks to bring this same cost-effective technology to passenger vehicles. A minivan can be adapted cost effectively to the technology because the hydraulic components are widely available in other industries. A joint engineering team will design and integrate the hydraulic hybrid system into a minivan, and test the demonstration vehicle in 2012. The minivan will feature a unique powertrain that replaces the automatic transmission.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA&amp;rsquo;s work for this project will take place at the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory. The EPA lab holds more than 60 patents with 25 pending and is at the forefront of the clean energy economy. In addition to advanced technology research, the lab tests and certifies vehicles to be sold in the U.S. and develops programs that prevent thousands of deaths each year and helps to strengthen the nation&amp;rsquo;s energy security. EPA&amp;rsquo;s lab is near the American auto industry capital of Detroit. All major international automakers have facilities in the Ann Arbor area to work closely with the lab.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Other key engineering partners working on this project include FEV of America Inc. of Auburn Hills, Mich., and Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio and Ann Arbor.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>CalPortland's DuPont aggregate plant earns environmental stewardship award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CalPortland Company&amp;#39;s DuPont aggregate plant in DuPont, Wash., has received the highest &amp;quot;Gold Award&amp;quot; from the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Association (NSSGA) for its superior performance in environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The awards program recognizes aggregates operations throughout the United States and Canada for their extraordinary commitment to safety, environmental stewardship and community involvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;CalPortland makes environmental leadership as well as energy efficiency vital elements of our core culture,&amp;quot; said CEO Allen Hamblen. &amp;quot;This award acknowledges the contributions that are continually being made by every CalPortland employee.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	NSSGA president and CEO Joy Wilson commented that: &amp;quot;Despite the continuing economic challenges this year, the responses from our member companies represent exemplary efforts of their employees on behalf of the aggregates industry. We are so pleased to be able to recognize these operations whose achievements in the fields of safety, environment and community relations remind us of the important role the aggregates industry plays in ensuring a greater quality of life in America.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CalPortland is a major producer of sand and gravel in the U.S. and the primary source of construction aggregates for the Puget Sound region. The state-of-the-art DuPont aggregate facility is a model of clean, efficient and environmentally conscious mining that meets or surpasses all environmental standards set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Washington State Department of Ecology and the Washington State Department of Natural Resources. Ninety-eight percent of material from the mine is used locally, from Everett to Olympia. Access to waterborne transportation allows 80 percent of material from DuPont to be shipped by barge. Each barge carries the equivalent of 150 to 200 truck and trailer loads of material, reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Transporting sand and gravel by barge lowers the region&amp;#39;s carbon output and reduces the economic and environmental cost of traffic congestion and other related road user costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>Toyota president outlines goals, mission for 2011 and beyond</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;The following &amp;quot;2011 New Year&amp;quot; message was delivered January 14 by Toyota president Akio Toyoda:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;&amp;quot;Toyota wants to be a company that is chosen by customers&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Toyota wants to be a company that makes customers happy they chose us.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;These are the conclusions that I have reached out of the many experiences of the past year.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	It goes without saying that Toyota is only one of the options customers can choose. &amp;nbsp;But when customers choose Toyota, we want to make sure they are happy with that choice.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The entire Toyota organization will unite in the effort to achieve this goal, for this year and beyond.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We are in the process of formulating a new vision toward 2020, a vision that will be the guideline for focusing our unity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	With this vision, I want to present the specific description of &amp;quot;a company that makes customers happy they chose Toyota&amp;quot; and the prerequisites to realizing that vision, such as &amp;quot;building better cars,&amp;quot; becoming the &amp;quot;most admired company in town&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;establishing a strong business base,&amp;quot; as well as a roadmap for getting there&amp;mdash;how we put down strong roots, how we grow our branches, how we blossom and how we produce the fruit of our vision. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I hope this vision will inspire all 300,000 Toyota members around the world and that it will lift the hopes and expectations of communities across the globe.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In April we hope to be able to show you the vision, including the directions and targets for a medium-term business structure reform plan to achieve the vision&amp;#39;s goals. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Year to Enhance Regional Management&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Obviously, different things make different customers happy, and trends will likely differ considerably from region to region. &amp;nbsp;This means that Toyota must play different roles in different parts of the world.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I have said repeatedly that in controlling different regions, we should not use the logic that Toyota has developed for Japan. &amp;nbsp;Rather, we want each region to create its own vision and strengthen its own local management. &amp;nbsp;Because Toyota is a multinational company, it must be the &amp;quot;most admired company in town&amp;quot; in each of the different regions it serves. &amp;nbsp;This is the year in which we begin to take concrete steps toward achieving that goal.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	While the head office will look out over the world and determine the basic direction of &amp;quot;what to do,&amp;quot; our basic approach will be to leave &amp;quot;how to do it&amp;quot; up to the local organization or those that are familiar with local circumstances. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;&amp;quot;An individualized Toyota Way with a Face&amp;quot; Is Important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;It should go without saying that in becoming &amp;quot;a company that makes customers happy they chose Toyota,&amp;quot; our primary focus is on the initiatives we began last year for restoring customer trust.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	As we move up to the date of the &amp;quot;Toyota restart,&amp;quot; February 24, the date of the U.S. &amp;nbsp;Congress hearings one year ago, I want to ask each of you to take practical actions in these initiatives; specifically, to promote &amp;quot;The Toyota Way with a face.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Last year, &amp;quot;Our Attitudes&amp;quot; was issued, and I believe that we are well on our way to putting it into practice.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	For example, I asked that we change the way we hold our internal meetings and events and that they become more of a &amp;quot;handmade&amp;quot; process, in which attendees take active roles. &amp;nbsp;As a result, we have been able to experience stronger, healthier teamwork.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This year I would like you to take a step forward and incorporate &amp;quot;Our Attitudes&amp;quot; into your own workplaces and the jobs of each individual, so as to practice &amp;quot;My Toyota Way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I want to see things like a &amp;quot;Toyota Way for the treasurer,&amp;quot; a &amp;quot;Toyota Way for the chief engineer,&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;Toyota Way for territorial Divisions working with independent distributors.&amp;quot; In short, we need an individualized Toyota Way &amp;quot;with a face.&amp;quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Achieving Earnings and Creating a Strong Base of &lt;em&gt;Monozukuri&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Another priority this year, on a par with restoring customer trust, is to realize earnings that will enable us to create a strong base of business and, more particularly, adapt to changes in foreign exchange rates.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I do not want to relocate production simply because of something like foreign exchange rates.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Toyota&amp;#39;s production facilities have all established a solid foundation of &lt;em&gt;monozukuri&lt;/em&gt;, though they have evolved differently and reached different degrees of maturity, depending on the timing of their establishment, their size and local community characteristics.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To be more specific, at each of our locations there is a mechanism or culture for achieving long-term human resources development, focusing on OJT(&lt;img alt="" height="9" src="http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/announcement/image/110114.gif" style="margin: 0px 4px" width="9" /&gt;) to train people in skills, professional abilities and technical expertise; a concentration of suppliers with excellent quality and delivery times, or a just-in-time logistics network. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal" style="text-align: right; display: block"&gt;(&lt;img alt="" height="9" src="http://www2.toyota.co.jp/en/announcement/image/110114.gif" style="margin: 0px 4px 0px 2px" width="9" /&gt;On the Job Training)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Relocating production facilities means abandoning the foundation of &lt;em&gt;monozukuri&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;It is not something I want to do.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If we are simply unable to make a profit, however, we may be forced to move our production elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Conversely, if we can create an organization that can turn a profit even in this difficult environment, we will be a company that can bring greater happiness to our customers through &lt;em&gt;monozukuri&lt;/em&gt; in each region.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Doing that requires that you stick to your work, stick to your own Toyota Way and never turn back, regardless of circumstances. &amp;nbsp;Each and every day we must improve the quality of our work, progressing one step at a time&amp;mdash;even a half step.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	By advancing through that process we will all grow; we will all experience satisfaction and achieve rewards. &amp;nbsp;This is what leads to the establishment of a strong base of business. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="normal"&gt;For the Resurgence of Toyota&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Unfortunately this year, last year&amp;#39;s challenges will continue, and it will be as difficult to see what lies ahead. &amp;nbsp;But that does not mean we should be pessimistic.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Our predecessors left us with enormous insights, skills and expertise, and we have added to them. &amp;nbsp;We have the culture to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We have the solidarity and the ability to focus&amp;mdash;which we proved last year, in our efforts to restore profitability and in our response to the hearings.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We have the technology, as demonstrated in our hybrids, and we have the practical skills for responding to changes in production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	We are now laying the groundwork for the next generation, as you can see in our joint venture with Tesla Motors,Inc. and our participation in the smart grid field-testing at Rokkasho-Mura. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;If we draw on these strengths, Toyota will bounce back. &amp;nbsp;I want to provide the kind of leadership that will foster our resurgence. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/9WicrHV6gG8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>NIPSCO to reduce emissions by more than 64,000 tons annually</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Justice Department on January 13 announced a global Clean Air Act settlement with Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO) that will cover all of NIPSCO&amp;rsquo;s coal-fired power plants, located in Chesterton, Michigan City, Wheatfield and Gary, Ind. NIPSCO has agreed to invest approximately $600 million in pollution control technology that will protect public health and resolve violations of the Clean Air Act.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The settlement will require that NIPSCO spend $9.5 million on environmental mitigation projects and pay a civil penalty of $3.5 million. The state of Indiana has been involved in the development of this settlement and is a signatory.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The pollution reductions achieved in this settlement will ensure that the people of Indiana and neighboring states have cleaner, healthier air to breathe,&amp;rdquo; said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. &amp;ldquo;EPA is committed to advancing its national enforcement initiative to reduce air pollution from the largest sources of emissions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This settlement will bring substantial reductions in sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter and carbon dioxide emissions that will benefit the health and environment of residents across Indiana and the surrounding area,&amp;rdquo; said Ignacia S. Moreno, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the Department of Justice. &amp;ldquo;Under the settlement, NIPSCO will achieve compliance with the Clean Air Act and reduce emissions from its entire coal-fired power plant system. This marks another positive step in our efforts, alongside EPA, to target large sources of air pollution and to bring about system and region-wide change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Under the settlement, NIPSCO will install pollution control technology at three of its four coal-fired power plants to comply with stringent emission rates and annual tonnage limitations. These actions will result in annual reductions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 18,000 tons and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 46,000 tons in addition to significant reductions of particulate matter emissions. The settlement also requires NIPSCO to permanently retire its fourth facility, the Dean H. Mitchell facility in Gary, Ind. The facility has been out of operation since 2002 and its permanent retirement will ensure that the facility does not restart without proper permitting under the Clean Air Act.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The settlement also calls for NIPSCO to spend $9.5 million on projects that will benefit the environment and human health in communities located near the NIPSCO facilities. The projects include a clean diesel retrofit project for public vehicles, woodstove and outdoor boiler change-out projects and land restoration projects to restore lands adjacent to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Reducing air pollution from the largest sources of emissions, including coal-fired power plants, is one of EPA&amp;rsquo;s National Enforcement Initiatives for 2011-2013. SO2 and NOx, two key pollutants emitted from power plants, have numerous adverse effects on human health and are significant contributors to acid rain, smog, and haze. These pollutants are converted in the air to fine particles of particulate matter that can cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular impacts, and premature death. Reducing these harmful air pollutants will benefit the communities located near NIPSCO facilities, particularly communities disproportionately impacted by environmental risks and vulnerable populations, including children. Considering that air pollution from power plants can drift significant distances downwind, this settlement will reduce air pollution outside the immediate region.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The settlement was lodged January 13 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana, and is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Honda revises green purchasing guidelines</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Striving to better track and reduce greenhouse gases and other aspects of its environmental footprint over the entire life cycle of Honda products including the business activities of its suppliers, Honda Motor Company Ltd. has revised the Honda Green Purchasing Guidelines formulated in 2001 to guide Honda&amp;rsquo;s environmental conservation activities in the area of purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Reflecting the globalization of Honda&amp;rsquo;s purchasing practices, Honda Green Purchasing Guidelines were revised in order to apply to all parts and materials suppliers around the world. With the new guidelines, Honda will strive to better track and reduce the environmental footprint of Honda products throughout the supply chain beyond primary suppliers. Starting in January 2011, Honda will sequentially share the revised guidelines with suppliers around the world and continue its efforts toward the realization of a low-carbon society on a global basis.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Since the announcement of the Honda Environmental Statement in 1992, environmental conservation activities have been one of the top priorities of Honda&amp;rsquo;s corporate activities. Honda has been committed not only to develop products with outstanding environmental performance, but also to take various environmentally-responsible measures in all areas of its corporate activities including purchasing, production, administration, logistics, sales, and recycling.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Realizing that a commitment to environmental issues is its corporate responsibility to customers and society, Honda will continue its effort to deliver products with the smallest environmental footprint to customers around the world, through corporate activities with the smallest environmental footprint.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&amp;bull; Outline of Honda Green Purchasing Guidelines and Key Revisions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>13 Japanese companies eye smooth domestic launch of FCVs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Nissan Motor Company, Honda Motor Company, JX Nippon Oil &amp;amp; Energy Corporation, Idemitsu Kosan Company, Iwatani Corporation, Osaka Gas Company, Cosmo Oil Company, Saibu Gas Company, Showa Shell Sekiyu K.K., Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, Tokyo Gas Company and Toho Gas Company jointly announced the following details regarding the launch of mass-produced fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) &amp;mdash; one of a number of potential next-generation vehicles &amp;mdash; in the Japanese market in 2015 and the development of the hydrogen supply infrastructure necessary for the successful adoption of the vehicles. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="20"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;As development of fuel-cell systems progresses, Japanese automakers are continuing to drastically reduce the cost of manufacturing such systems and are aiming to launch FCVs in the Japanese market &amp;mdash; mainly in the country&amp;#39;s four major metropolitan areas&amp;mdash;in 2015. &amp;nbsp;The automobile industry hopes to popularize the use of FCVs after their initial introduction as a way of tackling energy and environmental issues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;2.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Hydrogen fuel suppliers are aiming to construct approximately 100 hydrogen fueling stations by 2015, based on the number of FCVs expected to initially enter the market, to ensure a smooth launch and to create initial market.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;3.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				&lt;span class="normal"&gt;With an aim to significantly reduce the amount of CO&lt;span class="small"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emitted by the transportation sector, automakers and hydrogen fuel suppliers will work together to expand the introduction of FCVs and develop the hydrogen supply network throughout Japan. The two groups are looking to the government to join them in forming various strategies* to support their joint efforts and to gain greater consumer acceptance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="small"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;As a specific initiative in the immediate future, the companies plan to approach local governments and other concerned parties to discuss strategies for creating initial consumer demand for FCVs and for the optimal placement of hydrogen fueling stations, targeting Japan&amp;#39;s four major metropolitan areas (Tokyo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/N7nPGz5538o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>EPA to defer GHG permitting requirements for industries that use biomass</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is announcing its plan to defer, for three years, greenhouse gas (GHG) permitting requirements for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from biomass-fired and other biogenic sources. The agency intends to use this time to seek further independent scientific analysis of this complex issue and then to develop a rulemaking on how these emissions should be treated in determining whether a Clean Air Act permit is required.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are working to find a way forward that is scientifically sound and manageable for both producers and consumers of biomass energy. In the coming years we will develop a commonsense approach that protects our environment and encourages the use of clean energy,&amp;rdquo; said EPA administrator Lisa P. Jackson. &amp;ldquo;Renewable, homegrown power sources are essential to our energy future, and an important step to cutting the pollution responsible for climate change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	By July 2011, EPA plans to complete a rulemaking that will defer permitting requirements for CO2 emissions from biomass-fired and other biogenic sources for three years. During the three-year period, the agency will seek input on critical scientific issues from its partners within the federal government and from outside scientists who have relevant expertise. EPA will also further consider the more than 7,000 comments it received from its July 2010 Call for Information, including comments noting that burning certain types of biomass may emit the same amount of CO2 emissions that would be emitted if they were not burned as fuel, while others may result in a net increase in CO2 emissions. Before the end of the three-year period, the agency intends to issue a second rulemaking that determines how these emissions should be treated or counted under GHG permitting requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The agency will also issue guidance shortly that will provide a basis that state or local permitting authorities may use to conclude that the use of biomass as fuel is the best available control technology for GHG emissions until the agency can complete an action on the three-year deferral in July.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In a separate but related letter, EPA is notifying the National Alliance of Forest Owners that it will grant its petition to reconsider the portion of the May 2010 tailoring rule that addresses the same issue.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	CO2 emissions from biomass-fired and other biogenic sources are generated during the combustion or decomposition of biologically based material. Sources covered by this decision would include facilities that emit CO2 as a result of burning forest or agricultural products for energy, wastewater treatment and livestock management facilities, landfills and fermentation processes for ethanol production.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On January 2, 2011, air permitting requirements began for large GHG emitting industries that are planning to build new facilities or make major modifications to existing ones. These facilities must obtain air permits and implement energy efficiency measures or, where available, cost-effective technology to reduce their GHG emissions. This includes the nation&amp;#39;s largest GHG emitters, such as power plants and refineries. Emissions from small sources, such as farms and restaurants, are not covered by these GHG permitting requirements.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>IBM study: Electric cars stir interest but face obstacles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Many automobile industry executives believe that sales of traditional vehicles will peak before 2020 and are looking to electric-only vehicles (EVs) as one of the next hot products, but they will first have to address stringent consumer requirements about EV performance, recharging, and convenience, according to a new IBM survey of consumer attitudes and a recent study of auto industry executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Taken together, the two studies uncover significant differences between the automobile industry executives IBM spoke to and consumers on the factors motivating consumers to purchase electric vehicles, with auto execs placing greater emphasis than consumers on government incentives and oil prices. The executives were also skeptical of consumers&amp;#39; willingness to pay a premium for green vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The insights, from IBM&amp;#39;s Institute for Business Value (IBV), are derived from a new survey of 1,716 U.S. drivers(i) and interviews with 123 auto industry executives.(ii) The study indicates that, even in these early days, there is a potentially large market for EVs. Nineteen percent of drivers surveyed said that they were either &amp;quot;very likely&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;likely&amp;quot; to consider purchasing an electric-only vehicle when shopping for a new car. This is notable, given that 42 percent of drivers know only &amp;quot;a little&amp;quot; about EVs or have &amp;quot;only heard of them,&amp;quot; suggesting that automakers could increase the pool of potential buyers with sustained educational campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thirty percent of drivers surveyed said that they would consider switching to an EV that got 100 miles or less per charge. Current EVs get about 50 to 100 miles per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And 40 percent of drivers said they would pay up to 20 percent more for an electric-only vehicle compared with a similarly-featured gas-, diesel or hybrid-powered vehicle, with 27 percent saying they would pay 10 percent more and 13 percent saying they would pay 20 percent more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To drive the price of electric vehicles into this more affordable zone, the IBV research indicates that automakers should initially focus on sales to both consumers and commercial fleets, building scale and creating economic efficiencies in production. Automakers may also need to develop new business models for electric vehicles to overcome the higher initial price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Home charging: a sticking point&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Nevertheless, price of the home charging installation often required to support an EV could pose an obstacle to EV adoption. Only 13 percent of drivers said they would consider spending more than &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$1,000&lt;/span&gt; to retrofit their residence to support recharging of an electric vehicle. According to industry estimates, retrofitting to a 240 volt outlet accessible to vehicles averages between &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$1,000 and $2,000&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, two-thirds of consumers expect a price discount on their electricity for charging at home overnight. &amp;nbsp;This expectation could place increasing focus on utilities for time-based pricing to encourage home charging, or more public charging will be required if an electricity discount is not available. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Home charging is considered important to the success of EVs. Of the drivers surveyed, 83 percent said they park their primary vehicle in the driveway or garage of their private residence, as opposed to in a parking lot, on the street, in a shared garage or some other location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Even under optimal circumstances, fully recharging an electric-only vehicle takes hours,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Kal Gyimesi&lt;/span&gt;, IBV automotive lead and co-author of the IBV study. &amp;quot;So, it is crucially important that we build an infrastructure that can charge vehicles where their owners park them for extended periods of time &amp;ndash; whether that is at home or at work, school, or the store.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where to put those charging stations?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Perhaps a reflection of America&amp;#39;s consumer culture, 62 percent of drivers surveyed said they most often parked in a mall or store parking lot when not at home or work. That&amp;#39;s substantially higher than any other location &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;on the street&amp;quot; was number two at 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;When deciding where to put charging stations, retail hubs like malls and shopping centers are good locations,&amp;quot; Gyimesi said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s easy to envision charging stations in these commercial locations coupled with an advertising and promotion-based business model for local stores &amp;ndash; which will help make the economics more feasible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partnering with large employers in target regions to create charging infrastructure in the workplace also makes sense, Gyimesi added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Consumers were asked what would motivate them to switch from using a vehicle that currently runs on gasoline, diesel or hybrid to an electric-only vehicle. The same question was posed to automobile industry executives, who were asked to rate the importance consumers place on each choice. A chart summarizing responses follows:&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/colgroup&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The answers illustrate that the automobile industry executives IBM interviewed for this study place far greater weight than consumers on government incentives/regulations (73 percent to 41 percent) and significantly higher oil prices (76 percent to 51 percent). The executives also place less emphasis than consumers on green image/sustainability concerns (33 percent to 48 percent).&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the IBV study, when asked executives how automakers could develop mobility solutions, 83 percent said that the best direction would be to shift their product portfolio from conventional vehicles to electrified vehicles (EVs). About half said they expect the annual sales of conventional vehicles to have begun to decline by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Urban/Suburban/Rural Divide?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Responses for the driver survey were similar across urban, suburban and rural areas&amp;nbsp;-- with some notable exceptions. For example, rural respondents were the most likely (59 percent) to say they would pay nothing more for an electric-only vehicle compared with a similarly-featured gas-, diesel or hybrid-powered vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	(i) &amp;nbsp;To better understand consumer perceptions of electric vehicles, the IBM Institute for Business Value created a survey of general consumers whose primary mode of transportation is an automobile. The survey of a nationally representative sample of 1,716 American drivers (802 Urban, 469 Suburban and 445 Rural) has a margin of error for the base sample of &amp;nbsp;+/- 2.4% at the 95 percent confidence level and was fielded by Opinion Research Corporation (ORC) on &lt;span class="xn-chron"&gt;December 9-13, 2010&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Chevy Volt named 2011 North American Car of the Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Chevrolet Volt has been named the 2011 North American Car of the Year. The North American Car of the Year is selected by a jury of 49 automotive journalists from Canada and the United States, representing newspapers, magazines, websites, television and radio shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For 2011, the Volt garnered more juror votes than the Nissan Leaf or Hyundai Sonata, which were also finalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the third time Chevrolet has won the North American Car of the Year, and the fourth time for General Motors. Most recently, the Chevrolet Malibu was the 2008 North American Car of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a great honor to be recognized as the North American Car of the Year,&amp;rdquo; said GM CEO Dan Akerson. &amp;ldquo;Since development began, we believed the Volt had the potential to transform the automotive industry. Today, the Volt is the first electric vehicle to win the prestigious North American Car of the Year award, and the first vehicle ever to receive the industry&amp;rsquo;s highest automotive, technology, and environmental recognitions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The North American Car of the Year is the latest in a series of major awards presented to the Volt, which previously was named:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Such recognition provides customers with credible, expert endorsement of new models,&amp;rdquo; said Akerson. &amp;ldquo;This is particularly important for vehicles like the Volt that feature significant new technologies. Being named the North American Car of the Year will help convince customers that the Volt is truly a breakthrough vehicle, delivering the benefits of electric driving without the range anxiety associated with pure electric vehicles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Volt is an electric vehicle that can operate under a range of weather climates and driving conditions with little concern of being stranded by a depleted battery. The Volt has a total driving range of up to 379 miles, based on EPA estimates. For the first 35 miles, the Volt can drive gas- and tailpipe-emissions-free using a full charge of electricity stored in its 16-kWh lithium-ion battery. When the Volt&amp;rsquo;s battery runs low, a gas powered engine/generator seamlessly operates to extend the driving range another 344 miles on a full tank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In December, the first Volts were delivered to retail customers in California, Texas, Washington D.C. and New York. Due to strong public interest, Volt U.S. production is being raised to 45,000 Volts in 2012 from 30,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/tUNtRy0DVTY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chrysler launches 2011 line of battery-electric vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Chrysler Group Global Electric Motorcars LLC (GEM), a wholly owned subsidiary of Chrysler Group LLC, recently launched the 2011 GEM vehicle line of battery-electric vehicles. The GEM line is the market leader in the low-speed vehicle industry and more than 45,000 vehicles are on the road worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The 2011 model year marks our 13th year in designing and distributing 100 percent battery-electric GEM vehicles,&amp;rdquo; said Rick Kasper, president and chief operating officer for Chrysler Group Global Electric Motorcars LLC. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re always integrating new technologies and features into our product line that allow our customers to customize their vehicles and use them in a variety of capacities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	New for the 2011 GEM model year is the energy monitoring system, which allows drivers to determine the total amount of energy in kilo-watt-hours (kWh) that the GEM vehicle has removed from the grid. By using the trip meter, odometer switch in the vehicle, drivers can view the energy saving information right on the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s LCD screen. This feature is the first of its kind in the industry and allows drivers to actually see, and quantify, the positive impact that a GEM vehicle makes to the environment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Also new for 2011 are four vehicle options including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		12-inch turf tires for off-road applications&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Right-hand-drive package that converts the GEM vehicle into the perfect police or security vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Short-bed package that provides a 34&amp;rdquo; x 48&amp;rdquo; cargo bed on the GEM e4 four-passenger coupe or the GEM e6 six-passenger shuttle vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Utility tie downs that allow cargo to easily be secured in any of the GEM utility vehicles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With a top speed of 25 mph and a range of up to 30 miles on a charge, GEM electric vehicles are perfect for short-distance transportation and are driven on medical and corporate campuses, universities, military bases, resorts, sports stadiums, gated communities and residential streets. Classified as Low Speed Vehicles (LSV) or Neighborhood Electric Vehicles (NEV) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the GEM vehicle line is street-legal in most states on roads posted 35 mph or less.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	GEM vehicles are available in six models and can be customized with a variety of options and accessories. They can be used for running errands, driving to work or school, hauling equipment or transporting people around work facilities. With operating costs of only about two cents per mile, they have become an eco-friendly and cost-effective transportation alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/vYipzQRROHE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>U.S. files Clean Air Act complaint against Pennsylvania power plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Justice has filed a Clean Air Act complaint on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency against the owners and operators of the Homer City Generating Station, a coal-fired power plant in Homer City, Indiana County, Pa.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;The facility, located at 1750 Power Plant Road, is operated by EME Homer City Generation L.P. and currently owned by eight individual limited liability corporations. Prior owners, Pennsylvania Electric Company and New York State Electric &amp;amp; Gas Corporation are also cited in the complaint.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Clean Air Act was intended by Congress to protect the public from air pollution, including pollution from large sources of emissions like coal-fired power plants,&amp;rdquo; said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. &amp;ldquo;We are taking this step to protect the quality of the air people breathe not only in Homer City, but also in the communities that are located downwind of this power plant.&amp;rdquo; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;According to the complaint, beginning in 1990 the defendants violated the Clean Air Act New Source Review requirements by making major modifications to the boiler units at the power plant and continuing to operate without first obtaining appropriate permits and installing and operating the best available pollution control technologies to reduce sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;In addition, the complaint alleges that the defendants have not disclosed the plant&amp;rsquo;s major modifications, the need for best available control technologies, nor the appropriate emissions limits in their request for a Title V operating permit from Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s Department of Environmental Protection. Also, the defendants&amp;rsquo; Title V permit did not include the required limits on emissions that would be achieved using the best available pollution control technologies. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;In its complaint, the government seeks injunctive relief requiring the defendants to comply with all applicable Clean Air Act requirements and a monetary penalty.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Air emissions can have harmful effects to human health and the environment. Particulate matter &amp;ndash; from visible soot to microscopic particles &amp;ndash; can damage lung tissue and contribute to cardiovascular and respiratory disease. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is the major precursor for fine particles in the east coast. It interacts with the atmosphere to form sulfate aerosols, which can harm people who suffer from asthma or bronchitis. SO2 also helps form acid rain, which degrades forests, damages waterways and accelerates the decay of buildings.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;The complaint is part of a federal government initiative to bring operators of coal-fired power plants into full compliance with the New Source Review provisions of the Clean Air Act. For more information about New Source Review, visit &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/nsr/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" face="Arial"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/nsr/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Additional information about EPA enforcement to address Clean Air Act New Source Review compliance at coal-fired power plants, see &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/caa/coal/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;font color="#0000ff" face="Arial"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/caa/coal/index.html&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/JSX3pNNfrE0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Harnessing coke oven gas: Company converts waste gas into power</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Helping to meet China&amp;rsquo;s strict emission standards, Jiangsu Tianue Energy &amp;amp; Chemical Group Company Ltd. is building a high-efficiency gas turbine power plant to utilize industrial dismissed gas into power and steam to meet increasing energy needs in the region. The power plant will be equipped with three GE aeroderivative gas turbines, which are the first LM2500+G4 units sold in China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GE&amp;rsquo;s innovative technology allows us to turn a previously environmentally harmful gas into a useful tool to produce energy for our customers. In addition, we will be able to reduce CO2 emissions by 300,000 tons per year and supply stable electricity to Pei County,&amp;rdquo; said Teng Daochun, chairman, Jiangsu Tianue Energy &amp;amp; Chemical Group Company Ltd. &amp;ldquo;This project is an important step in increasing the value of coke oven gas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	GE&amp;rsquo;s LM2500+G4 aeroderivative gas turbines will use coke oven gas (COG) as fuel and turn it into electricity for the region. COG is a byproduct of the coking manufacturing process. Among all of the current treatment methods, GE&amp;rsquo;s solution is more reliable, cleaner for the environment and uses the residual energy at a higher efficiency rate. GE also is providing a 12-year services agreement with one spare engine to ensure maximum operability at the new plant.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our LM2500+G4 is a powerful gas turbine with high efficiency, which has the potential to translate into operational savings and increased revenue potential for the customer&amp;rsquo;s operations,&amp;rdquo; said Darryl Wilson, vice president of aeroderivative gas turbines for GE Power &amp;amp; Water. &amp;ldquo;Using our aeroderivative technology for low-calorie, coke-oven gas is a technology breakthrough, and this project is another example of GE&amp;rsquo;s commitment to invest in progressive solutions to meet environmental challenges throughout the world. Through this endeavor, GE and Tianue are responding to the Chinese government&amp;rsquo;s call to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by conserving energy and making contributions to a cleaner economy in the country.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The announcement is part of a series of commitments GE has made in China. On November 9, 2010, GE announced plans to invest more than $2 billion into its efforts in China through 2012 to help tackle the country&amp;rsquo;s pressing energy and infrastructure needs. GE chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt announced that the company plans to commit $500 million to enhance China R&amp;amp;D capabilities and establish new Customer Innovation Centers to better serve west, north, central and south China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On the same day, as part of the $2 billion investment, GE and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC), China&amp;rsquo;s top power distributor and one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest utilities, announced plans for several joint ventures to address China&amp;rsquo;s growing energy needs and to electrify its vast transportation infrastructure. These joint ventures will play a vital role in supporting the country&amp;rsquo;s energy demand through the development of a smarter grid that will help achieve environmental and economical goals.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Jiangsu Tianue Energy and Chemical Group Company Ltd. is a large and advanced private enterprise group, dealing mainly in coal washing, coking, power generation, coal-gas supply, mining, etc. Formerly known as Xuzhou Huanyu Molybdenum Industry, it is the first Sino-foreign joint venture in Xuzhou. It has passed ISO9002 quality system authentication, gained coking industry access in 2008 and also passed OHSMS occupational health and safety management system authentication.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Sustainability report illustrates environmental progress for electronics industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) on January 4 released the &lt;em&gt;CEA 2010 Sustainability Report&lt;/em&gt; to highlight the tremendous progress the industry has made in its green initiatives, from designing more energy efficient products to cutting greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) at facilities, to developing a national electronics recycling infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report, an update to CEA&amp;rsquo;s first-ever sustainability report in 2008, tracks the industry&amp;rsquo;s green efforts throughout a consumer electronics (CE) product&amp;rsquo;s entire life cycle. The &lt;em&gt;CEA 2010 Sustainability Report &lt;/em&gt;contains 21 separate case studies from a variety of CE companies illustrating progress in their environmental efforts. The report further provides transparency on green practices across the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The consumer electronics industry is committed to greening its products and practices for the benefit of consumers, communities and the overall environment,&amp;rdquo; said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CEA. &amp;ldquo;In the past three years, we&amp;rsquo;ve made great strides in our environmental efforts, by creating more green products, improving energy efficiency and deepening our commitment to electronics recycling. We know there is work remaining, and we will press forward with these initiatives in 2011 and beyond.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Following are some highlights of environmental progress evidenced in the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Greener designs:&lt;/strong&gt;Industry-wide unit sales of U.S. products registered with EPEAT (Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool) grew by 10 percent in 2009, to a total of 48.5 million products. Individual companies also made noteworthy milestones in green design. One manufacturer, for instance, conducted a comprehensive life cycle analysis for every product it ships to determine where greenhouse gases are created. After discovering 97 percent of the emission derived from manufacturing and product use, the company focused on designing new products that use less material, smaller packaging, and are as energy efficient and recyclable as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Green packaging&lt;/strong&gt;: Many consumer electronics companies are switching to renewable materials, including bio-based plastics, or recyclable materials instead of clamshell packaging and are looking to reduce the amount of packaging they use. For instance, one video service provider consolidated its shipments and decreased its use of cartons by more than one million in 2009 &amp;mdash; a 75 percent reduction from the previous year. In 2011, all of the providers&amp;rsquo; products will be packed with 100 percent recyclable materials.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More efficient facilities:&lt;/strong&gt;Many manufacturers have set ambitious goals for reducing GHG at their facilities. Meanwhile, other companies have launched efforts to cut power consumption at their data centers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;More energy efficient products:&lt;/strong&gt;According to the EPA, 27,000 CE product models currently meet ENERGY STAR specifications. The average energy savings of ENERGY STAR electronics devices range from 20 to 55 percent. An example of this progress is one semiconductor design company created a chip that can reduce its GHG by up to 40 percent by combining the processing and graphics processing units and the Northbridge chipset onto a single chip.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;eCycling: &lt;/strong&gt;The consumer electronics industry recycled 200 million pounds in 2009, and industry supports more than 5,000 permanent collection sites nationwide. Some examples of these efforts include one CE retailer collecting 100 million pounds at its 1,200 U.S. locations and one computer manufacturer operating an eCycling program at more than 2,200 U.S. Goodwill sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The CE industry&amp;rsquo;s commitment to sustainability is unmistakable,&amp;rdquo; said Walter Alcorn, CEA&amp;rsquo;s vice president of environmental affairs and industry sustainability. &amp;ldquo;More and more, our member companies are finding what makes good environmental sense also makes good business sense in the form of reduced costs and invigorated employees. Our sustainability efforts will continue in earnest this year, and CEA will continue to provide the resources to member companies to help bolster these initiatives.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The full report is available at &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CE.org%2Fgreen&amp;amp;esheet=6560590&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=www.CE.org%2Fgreen&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=4c90175f6d8e2c8eb37727963e91ea88" target="_blank"&gt;www.CE.org/green&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About CEA:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is the preeminent trade association promoting growth in the $170 billion U.S. consumer electronics industry. More than 2,000 companies enjoy the benefits of CEA membership, including legislative advocacy, market research, technical training and education, industry promotion, standards development and the fostering of business and strategic relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/hlS_godXA7s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>The history of electric vehicles: A 21st-century timeline</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The past decade has been the most significant 10-year period for electric vehicles (EVs) since the first 10 years of the 20th century, when 38 percent of cars in 1900 were &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/in-1917-electric-vehicles-reigned-and-edison-charged-them/" jquery1293737240702="8"&gt;charging up, many with the aid of Thomas Edison-designed electric technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The renewed excitement that EVs garnered among carmakers in the late 1990s gave way to &amp;hellip; almost nothing. But in the past few years, EVs have suddenly been reborn, and they&amp;rsquo;re now becoming a central aspect of development strategy for major car manufacturers. (&lt;a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-30/tesla-says-electric-car-battery-plan-means-profit-at-low-volume.html" jquery1293737240702="9"&gt;Just today, Tesla Motors said&lt;/a&gt; that cheaper batteries will mean its $57,000 Model S sedan, which uses cells like those in laptops, can turn a profit with fewer unit sales).&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>DuPont earns prestigious sustainability award for recycling program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	DuPont recently received the 2010 Premio ECO Award in the Product Sustainability category for its role in a closed-loop recycling process for agrochemical multilayer bottles.&amp;nbsp;DuPont Latin America president Eduardo Wanick accepted the award during an international ceremony in S&amp;auml;o Paulo, Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;Virtuous Cycle using Fusabond&amp;rdquo; project relies on the unique characteristic of DuPont&amp;nbsp;Fusabond&amp;nbsp;coupling agent to compatibilize and bond dissimilar polymers in the recycling process. Fusabond also improves impact resistance, surface finish and processability of parts and films so the recycled product can be used to form other articles with little material loss and great added value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table align="right" style="height: 253px" width="217"&gt;

		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
				In the award-winning &amp;ldquo;Virtuous Cycle using Fusabond&amp;rdquo; program, agrochemical multilayer bottles are recycled into high-value industrial applications - shown here in flexible corrugated pipes.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Empty agricultural chemical packaging is collected by the National Institute for the Processing of Empty Packaging (inPEV), launched by government mandate and initially supported by 22 founding companies, including DuPont.&amp;nbsp;Since 2002, more than 150,000 tons of empty packaging has been collected, eliminating the need for 374,000 barrels of crude oil and more than 160,000 tons of CO2 equivalents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	Brazil is a leader in collecting used agricultural chemical packaging with a 95 percent&amp;nbsp;collection rate, compared with Canada (73%), Germany (76%), France (66%) and the United States&amp;nbsp;(30%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	The ECO Award, organized by Amcham (American Chamber of Commerce) and newspaper Valor Economico, was launched in 1982 and awards socially responsible companies and emerging sustainable practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;

Innovative programs such as these evolve when the entire value chain is engaged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="largeText"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;DuPont contributes to global food production by providing products and services that help ensure food safety, higher crop yields and healthier foods,&amp;rdquo; Eduardo said.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;DuPont is uniquely focused across the value chain allowing us to introduce customized solutions based on our holistic view of global food production. Reducing the negative effects on the environment requires collaborative innovation throughout the value chain focused on a common goal of a sustainable future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/1yz6e8qaJNI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE engineering ways to reduce rare metal rhenium in jets</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Few people have ever heard of rhenium &amp;mdash; a rare and semi-precious metal &amp;mdash; but it&amp;rsquo;s an important material in the aerospace industry. Modern jet engines require rhenium as an alloying element &amp;mdash; critical to the performance of commercial, military and even rocket engines used for space exploration. Rhenium also happens to be one of the rarest elements on earth, mined mostly in the U.S, Chile and Kazakhstan. All engine manufacturers use it because it allows engines to reach higher temperatures required in jet flight and to consume less fuel when operating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a &lt;a href="http://citizenship.geblogs.com/rhenium-reduction-program-using-less-of-a-rare-mineral/" jquery1293570911039="8"&gt;new feature story just published on GE&amp;rsquo;s Citizenship Web site&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; which we&amp;rsquo;ve excerpted here &amp;mdash; explains in detail, for the past 10 years GE Aviation has been working to lessen its dependence on rare minerals, including rhenium. The work is being accomplished through a combination of innovative component designs, advanced manufacturing processes and new alloys. Recycling materials from unserviceable engine parts is also being practiced to reduce the need for rhenium as a raw material in jet engine manufacturing. Through the GE Reclamation Program, GE Aviation is producing better outcomes for GE, its customers and the environment, saving millions of dollars by using recycled material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The goal of the program is to recycle, reuse and replace this rare metal,&amp;rdquo; said Ted Grossman, chief manufacturing engineer, GE Aviation. &amp;ldquo;Not only will it help us reduce our need for rhenium and lower costs, it is reducing the environmental impact associated with mining activities and material disposal.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When alloyed with other materials from the periodic table, rhenium helps create strong superalloys necessary for the manufacture of high-pressure turbine (HPT) blades used in jet engines today. As early as the 1980s, engine makers discovered that nickel-based alloys containing rhenium were able to retain their strength at extremely high temperatures, providing durability, wear and extended life for certain engine components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Not only is rhenium extremely rare at an average concentration of two parts per billion in the earth&amp;rsquo;s crust, it is very difficult to extract. Rhenium is not mined, but rather recovered and extracted as a byproduct of copper mining. Very little rhenium is actually processed and isolated each year as compared to the millions of tons of copper and millions of pounds of molybdenum that are extracted from the same copper deposits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To put this into perspective, consider the following scenario. It takes, on average, approximately 120 metric tons (264,554 pounds) &amp;mdash; or the equivalent weight of 44 Cadillac Escalade SUVs &amp;mdash; of copper ore to produce 1 ounce of rhenium &amp;mdash; or the equivalent weight of five U.S. quarter coins. The production of one HPT blade requires about 0.5 ounces of rhenium. The extraction processes required to mine that material are significant, as are the environmental impacts and carbon emissions that go along with them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE&amp;rsquo;s three-pronged approach involves recycling metal grindings from the manufacturing process; GE Aviation metallurgists and engineers developing alloys that require less or zero rhenium; and reclaiming rhenium from used engine parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;The &lt;a href="http://www.ge.com/citizenship/" jquery1293570911039="9"&gt;full story on GE.com/citizenship&lt;/a&gt; explains how customers such as the U.S. Navy, one of the first participants in the reclamation program, are reaping huge cost savings and how the GE Aviation team is currently working to expand the program.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>EPA completes framework for greenhouse gas permitting programs</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is issuing the final series of actions that will ensure that the largest industrial facilities can get Clean Air Act permits that cover greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beginning in January 2011. These actions are part of EPA&amp;rsquo;s common sense approach to GHG permitting outlined in the spring 2010 tailoring rule.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The first set of actions will give EPA authority to permit GHGs in seven states (Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Oregon and Wyoming) until the state or local agencies can revise their permitting regulations to cover these emissions. EPA is taking additional steps to disapprove part of Texas&amp;#39; Clean Air Act permitting program and the agency will also issue GHG permits to facilities in the state. These actions will ensure that large industrial facilities will be able to receive permits for greenhouse gas emissions regardless of where they are located.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the second set of actions, EPA has issued final rules that will ensure that there are no federal laws in place that require any state to issue a permit for GHG emissions below levels outlined in the tailoring rule.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA has worked closely with the states to ensure that the transition to permitting for GHGs is smooth. States are best suited to issue permits to sources of GHG emissions and have experience working with industrial facilities. EPA will continue to work with states to help develop, submit, and obtain approval of the necessary revisions to enable the affected states to issue air permits to GHG-emitting sources.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Beginning in January 2011, industries that are large emitters of GHGs, and are planning to build new facilities or make major modifications to existing ones, must obtain air permits and implement energy efficiency measures or, where available, cost-effective technology to reduce their GHGs emissions. This includes the nation&amp;#39;s largest GHG emitters, such as power plants, refineries and cement production facilities. Emissions from small sources, such as farms and restaurants are not covered by these GHG permitting requirements.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Caterpillar facilities achieve zero waste to landfill in 2010</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In line with Caterpillar Inc.&amp;#39;s global commitment to sustainable development, two Caterpillar facilities achieved zero waste to landfill in 2010. The Caterpillar Remanufacturing &amp;amp; Components Division United Kingdom Hose Assembly (UKHA) plant in Leicester, England, and the Caterpillar Logistics Services (Cat Logistics) Desford, England operations have reached 100 percent recycling in their respective facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Caterpillar recognizes that providing sustainable solutions starts with having sustainable operations. That&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;ve established corporate long-term goals focused on sustainability for all of our operations worldwide,&amp;quot; said Caterpillar chairman and CEO Doug Oberhelman. &amp;quot;One of those operational goals is to eliminate waste by reducing waste generation and reusing or recycling all that remains.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Cat Logistics Desford facility consists of several buildings housing both warehouse operations and administrative offices. It provides a wide range of logistics services to many different customers and distributes materials worldwide. A global operation of this magnitude generates tons of waste each year, and the facility has had a longstanding recycling program in place. In 2008, a project team set the goal of zero landfill and 100-percent of waste recycled. Implemented in March 2009, the new processes quickly improved recycling percentages to such an extent that on October 2010, the site was able to record one full year of 100-percent recycling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cat Logistics&amp;#39; site services manager, Paul Morris, applauds the remarkable achievement. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re extremely proud of the results of this project. It&amp;#39;s a great thing for the environment but it&amp;#39;s also great for our business. We&amp;#39;ve taken what used to be a cost and turned it into an asset.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cat Logistics Desford facility results include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Segregation of waste has increased considerably from an original six different streams to more than 30 today and so increasing recycling opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Many of the waste streams are now baled/bundled. Baling waste has many advantages including increased weight per volume and reduced transportation costs. The baling has reduced transportation involved by 50-percent when moving waste off site. The best example is shipping cardboard, which was previously only two tons per vehicle, and baling has increased loads to 22 tons per vehicle &amp;ndash; an 11-fold improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Office waste was originally all collected in a single bin and sent to landfill. The introduction of smaller desktop bins has encouraged everyone to generate less waste, and segregated collection points has ensured all material is recycled.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Through increased knowledge of the recycling industry, the facility has been able to increase recycling and prepare waste to ensure it can be recycled and the best price obtained.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A $183,984 (pounds Sterling 116,372) cost saving was realized in the first year following implementation of the new processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Desford facility achievements have been recognized throughout England. It has received the Green Apple Award from The Green Organization and reached the finals of the National Recycling Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The UKHA facility achieved zero landfill by effectively increasing the facility&amp;#39;s recycling rate by an additional 25 to 30 percent from previous years. &amp;quot;This was a great team effort by everyone at UKHA to achieve 100-percent facility recycling in 2010,&amp;quot; said Pete Lee, UKHA Environmental Health and Safety Specialist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	UKHA project results include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A total waste management system was developed to maximize revenues generated from recyclables and to start recycling waste rubber hydraulic hoses.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A system was created to ensure UKHA reaches and maintains 100-percent facility recycling.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		The environmental metrics reporting procedure was simplified and streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A $15,562 (pounds 9,843) cost savings has been realized since the implementation of the project in September 2009.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Caterpillar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	For more than 85 years, Caterpillar Inc. has been making sustainable progress possible and driving positive change on every continent.

            <title>Chevy Volt builds on earlier GM electrification efforts</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Chevrolet Volts now being delivered to enthusiastic retail customers would not have been possible without the lessons learned from previous General Motors electrification efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the technologies resulting from the development of the ground-breaking EV1 in the 1990s, the Two-Mode hybrid SUVs and pickup trucks and the fuel cell Chevrolet Equinox used for the Project Driveway program are part of the Volt.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The band is back together &amp;ndash; only this time there are fans,&amp;quot; said former EV1 chief engineer Jon Bereisa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Regardless of whether a vehicle uses a hydrogen-powered fuel cell, a battery charged from the grid or just recovered kinetic energy from a hybrid drive system, the electric propulsion systems feature many common components and sub-systems. Traction motors and generators, power electronics and battery management systems work in much the same way for each. Improving one type can benefit all.&amp;nbsp; Each alternative drive vehicle also relies on systems like electric power assisted steering, electronic brake control and electric climate control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While earlier vehicles were not built in mass-production numbers, many of the engineers that created them also contributed to the Volt development, including chief engineer Andrew Farah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;By adapting sub-systems such as the EV1-descended motors developed for the front-wheel drive hybrid system and electronically controlled brakes from the fuel cell Equinox, the engineers were able to focus more resources on the new lithium ion battery and overall vehicle integration,&amp;rdquo; said Farah. The hardware engineers weren&amp;rsquo;t the only ones to benefit from the earlier programs. &amp;ldquo;A new drive system like this involves a lot of complex control software such as the regenerative brake blending which benefited from the Two-Mode hybrid development.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the transportation ecosystem moves from a dependence on petroleum over the coming decades, electrification will allow vehicle engineers to separate the propulsion and energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;In the future, vehicles will likely combine different energy systems including batteries, ultra capacitors and hydrogen fuel cells with common and scalable electric drives systems depending on regional and application needs,&amp;rdquo; said Daniel O&amp;rsquo;Connell, director of fuel cell commercialization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And the advancements will pay off in future generations of the Volt and other electric and hybrid vehicles coming to market.&amp;nbsp; Even traditional internal combustion vehicles like the new Chevrolet Cruze and the 2012 Buick LaCrosse with eAssist consume and pollute less thanks to the use of more energy efficient systems developed for electrified vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Throughout GM&amp;rsquo;s first century, internal combustion engines were the heart of the company&amp;rsquo;s products. GM engineers are now using the lessons learned over the past two decades to make electric propulsion and energy storage systems a core competency for the next century,&amp;rdquo; said Jamie Hresko, vice president of Global Powertrain Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/NSoUru6kox8" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>DOE boosts electric vehicle manufacturing and infrastructure with $184 million grant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu announced on December 16 that the U.S. Department of Energy will start accepting applications up to $184 million to accelerate the development and deployment of new efficient vehicle technologies.&amp;nbsp;Projects will span the broad spectrum of technology approaches, including advanced materials, combustion research, hybrid electric systems, fleet efficiency, and fuels technology.&amp;nbsp;Ultimately, the projects will reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil, save drivers money, and limit carbon air pollution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The&amp;nbsp;U.S. remains the largest vehicle market in the world, according to market analyses by energy research firm SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt;. Of the 204 million personal vehicles, the average U.S. household owns 1.9 vehicles, which is slightly more than the average number of drivers per household. Most personal vehicles rely on the internal combustion engine and burn gasoline fuel at an average rate of one gallon every 20 miles. Compare that to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) fuel consumption and it&amp;#39;s a completely different picture. SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt; estimates that HEVs consume an estimated 6.3 million gallons (in gasoline equivalents) compared to 198 million gallons of compressed natural gas and 138 million gallons of liquefied petroleum gasoline. By 2014, SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt; expects electric fuel consumption in the U.S. to grow to nearly 9 million gallons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt; report, &lt;strong&gt;Electric Vehicle (EV) and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) Markets Worldwide&lt;/strong&gt;, in the six years between 2004 and 2009, the number of HEV available models around the world has tripled to 29 and the number of brands producing hybrids has jumped from six to fourteen. In fact, almost a third of the hybrids being offered in the U.S. have 2010 as their first model year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Global sales of hybrid electric vehicles rose 33 percent&amp;nbsp;in 2009 with 700,000 vehicles sold in an unfavorable climate that saw the overall auto market plunge worldwide.&amp;nbsp;SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt; calculates that sales of hybrids accounted for 99% of all electric vehicle sales in 2009 worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;[The DOE] awards will help ensure America leads the world in the development of advanced vehicle technologies that support cost-competitive, convenient, and comfortable fuel-efficient vehicles,&amp;quot; said Secretary Chu in the DOE press release. &amp;quot;Investments in the next generation of vehicle technologies are laying the groundwork for a sustainable transportation sector in America that strengthens our economy and improves our economic competitiveness.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt;, future growth of the electric vehicle market on a global scale will depend on three key motivators: government incentives to consumers to purchase fuel efficient vehicles; any increase in the price of crude oil and gas prices at the pumps; and a reduction in the price differential between hybrids and non-hybrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; first EV market study entitled, &lt;strong&gt;Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure Manufacturing&lt;/strong&gt; projects North America will hold 20% of the electric vehicle infrastructure manufacturing market by 2014, driven by government incentive programs and the movement toward eco-friendly consumer lifestyles,&amp;quot; says Shelley Carr, publisher for SBI &lt;em&gt;Energy&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;While government capital is vital, growth also depends heavily on the investment interests of the private sector and the adoption of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles by consumers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/71Wqwv3lZzs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>DuPont to pay $3.3M to settle EPA case for failure to report toxic chemical studies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on December 21 announced that DuPont has agreed to pay a penalty of $3.3 million to resolve 57 Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) violations. DuPont failed to immediately notify EPA of research indicating substantial risk found during testing chemicals for possible use as surface protection, masonry protection, water repellants, sealants and paints. The Toxic Substances Control Act requires companies to inform EPA when they have research demonstrating that a chemical could pose a substantial risk to human health and the environment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;DuPont failed to comply with the law and notify EPA that it had information on chemicals that could pose a risk to human health and the environment,&amp;rdquo; said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. &amp;ldquo;EPA is serious about making companies follow our nation&amp;rsquo;s laws and protecting public health.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	On May 5, 2006, DuPont notified EPA that it had failed to submit chemical toxicity studies on ratsas required by TSCA Section 8(e). On July 12, 2006, DuPont submitted studies that contained information on chemical toxicity when certain chemicals are inhaled. EPA determined that 57 of the studies contained information on chemicals that could present a substantial risk of injury to health or the environment and therefore subject to the TSCA Section 8(e). Full compliance with TSCA reporting requirements allows EPA to understand and limit, when necessary, potential hazards associated with manufacturing, use, and disposal of chemical substances.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	DuPont is a chemical manufacturer that provides products and services for markets including agriculture, nutrition, electronics, communications, safety and protection, home and construction, transportation and apparel. DuPont is based in Wilmington, Del., and operates in approximately 90 countries.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Chevrolet Volt components created from Gulf of Mexico oil-soaked booms</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Oil-soaked plastic boom material used to soak up oil in the Gulf of Mexico is finding new life as auto parts in the Chevrolet Volt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors has developed a method to convert an estimated 100 miles of the material off the Alabama and Louisiana coasts and keep it out of the nation&amp;rsquo;s landfills. The ongoing project is expected to create enough plastic under hood parts to supply the first year production of the extended-range electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Creative recycling is one extension of GM&amp;rsquo;s overall strategy to reduce its environmental impact,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Robinson, GM vice president of Environment, Energy and Safety policy. &amp;ldquo;We reuse and recycle material by-products at our 76 landfill-free facilities every day. This is a good example of using this expertise and applying it to a greater magnitude.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Recycling the booms will result in the production of more than 100,000 pounds of plastic resin for the vehicle components, eliminating an equal amount of waste that would otherwise have been incinerated or sent to landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The parts, which deflect air around the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s radiator, are comprised of 25 percent boom material and 25 percent recycled tires from GM&amp;rsquo;s Milford Proving Ground vehicle test facility. The remaining is a mixture of post-consumer recycled plastics and other polymers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM worked with several partners throughout the recovery and development processes. Heritage Environmental managed the collection of boom material along the Louisiana coast. Mobile Fluid Recovery stepped in next, using a massive high-speed drum that spun the booms until dry and eliminated all the absorbed oil and wastewater. Lucent Polymers used its process to then manipulate the material into the physical state necessary for plastic die-mold production. Tier-one supplier, GDC Inc., used its patented EndurapreneTM material process to combine the resin with other plastic compounds to produce the components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The work in the Gulf is expected to last at least two more months and GM will continue to assist suppliers in collecting booms until the need no longer exists. The automaker anticipates enough material will be gathered that it can be used as components in other Chevrolet models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This was purely a matter of helping out,&amp;rdquo; said John Bradburn, manager of GM&amp;rsquo;s waste-reduction efforts. &amp;ldquo;If sent to a landfill, these materials would have taken hundreds of years to begin to break down, and we didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see the spill further impact the environment. We knew we could identify a beneficial reuse of this material given our experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The world&amp;rsquo;s first electric vehicle with extended range, the Chevy Volt was recently awarded Green Car of the Year by Green Car Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM is dedicated to reducing its waste and pollutants, and recycles materials at every state of the product lifecycle. It uses recycled and renewable materials in its cars and trucks, which are at least 85 percent recyclable. Used tires, old plastic bottles, denim and nylon carpet are all redirected from landfills and reused in select GM vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM facilities worldwide recycle 90 percent of the waste they generate. The automaker recently announced more than half of its worldwide facilities are now landfill-free &amp;ndash; all manufacturing waste is recycled or used to create energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/QzBOM1ZJX1I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE evaluating EPA plan for next phase of Hudson River cleanup</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE has received and is reviewing the engineering performance standards issued December 17 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the second phase of the Hudson River dredging project, one of the largest environmental cleanups ever conducted in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GE made a public commitment eight years ago to cooperate with EPA on this project,&amp;rdquo; the company stated in a press release. &amp;ldquo;We designed and conducted the first phase of dredging in 2009. For months, GE and EPA have worked constructively together to address the technical and logistical issues in the next phase of the project. GE will carefully evaluate EPA&amp;rsquo;s plan. If we determine that the plan is consistent with our technical discussions with EPA, that it is based on sound science, and that it is feasible to achieve, we expect to move forward with Phase 2. We will advise EPA of our decision by mid-January.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this week, GE told securities analysts it would review the details of EPA&amp;rsquo;s decision and adjust its reserves as appropriate in 2010. As stated to analysts, this is expected to take the matter of Hudson dredging costs off the table as an issue for investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/tbody&gt;
	&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Conducted in real-world urban transportation environments, the program will focus on motorcycles, automobiles and power products based on electromotive technologies. The comprehensive program will also use advanced communications &amp;amp; telematics and solar-powered charging technologies to explore future forms of personal mobility and their potential of CO2 emissions reduction.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Major objectives of the Electric Vehicle Testing Program&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In March 2009, Honda and Saitama Prefecture concluded an agreement to collaborate on environmental issues. Based on this agreement, Honda will start an Electric Vehicle Testing Program in the cities of Saitama, Kumagaya and Chichibu that features advanced electromotive technology and communications &amp;amp; telematics to realize a low-carbon mobility society in the future. The program will study the following:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;img alt="" height="14" src="http://world.honda.com/news/2010/image/shiromaru.gif" width="11" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top" width="549"&gt;
				The practicality and convenience of electromotive technology featured on next-generation personal mobility products, including Honda&amp;#39;s EVs and plug-in hybrid vehicles, the EV-neo electric scooter and the Monpal ML200 4-wheel electric cart.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr align="left" valign="center"&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" height="14" src="http://world.honda.com/news/2010/image/shiromaru.gif" width="11" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				The effectiveness of solar power generation and other renewable energy sources in helping to realize a low-carbon mobility society.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr align="left" valign="center"&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" height="14" src="http://world.honda.com/news/2010/image/shiromaru.gif" width="11" /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td valign="top"&gt;
				The effectiveness of advanced communications &amp;amp; telematics to enhance customer convenience and product usability.&lt;br /&gt;
				&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on the results of the program, Honda plans to further advance its electromotive technologies for personal mobility products. In combination with Honda&amp;#39;s strong position in solar panels, cogeneration systems and other energy-generating products, these electromotive technologies will help Honda work together with customers to achieve the goal of &amp;quot;Total Energy Management&amp;quot;, a system that supplies households and communities with energy for personal use, while supporting a comfortable, low-carbon lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Earlier on December 15, 2010, Honda announced this Electric Vehicle Testing Program in the United States (Torrance, California). In addition to Japan and the United States, Honda is considering the possibility of conducting a similar program in China.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Vehicle Testing Program in Saitama Prefecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Honda will implement an Electric Vehicle Testing Program that explores the roles of next-generation personal mobility products in urban, suburban, tourist-focused and other types of traffic environments, in the cities of Saitama, Kumagaya and Chichibu. The following are the program objectives for each city:&lt;br /&gt;

	Even when away from the test vehicle, a customer can view a map on their smartphone of how far the vehicle can drive on its remaining battery charge, and also search for charging stations within that area. The customer can then select a charging station from the search results, forward the station information to the vehicle via InterNavi Information Center, and set the station destination on the navigation screen. The navigation system will then guide the customer to the charging destination.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Crown Equipment recognized by EPA for environmental stewardship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Crown Equipment Corporation, one of the world&amp;rsquo;s leading forklift manufacturers, was recently recognized for its sustainability efforts by earning Ohio&amp;rsquo;s annual award for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship. Crown&amp;rsquo;s New Knoxville, Ohio, manufacturing facility received the award for accomplishing zero landfill waste output and achieving ISO 14001 Certificate of Registration. This is the third year Crown has received the award for its sustainability initiatives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During a ceremony at the Ohio Statehouse, Chris Korleski, director of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, recognized Crown&amp;rsquo;s commitment to minimizing waste, managing energy and maximizing lifespan. Crown is one of only two winners selected from a number of Ohio corporations, nonprofit organizations and state government agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Winners of the award are selected based on a sound track record of environmental compliance and a commitment to go above and beyond regulations to improve environmental performance; a mature Environmental Management System that has been integrated into core business functions; aggressive environmental performance goals; and a process for communicating with the local community about program activities and progress on performance goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These award winners employ forward-thinking individuals and have developed innovative concepts for waste reduction and prevention that can serve as examples for other manufacturing facilities,&amp;rdquo; Korleski said. &amp;ldquo;They have shown a commitment to being good environmental stewards, protecting Ohio&amp;#39;s environment and natural resources, increasing company efficiency and improving the quality of life and the environment in local communities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown was previously honored by the Ohio EPA in 1992 and 2008, and has been recognized at the federal level in 2004 and 2005 as part of the U.S. EPA&amp;rsquo;s Waste Minimization Partner and National Partnership for Environmental Priorities programs, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s New Knoxville, Ohio, facility achieved zero landfill status in late 2009. The 40,000-square-foot facility, which manufactures electric motors and plastic parts, recycles 96 percent of its waste. The remaining four percent (less than 1 ton per month) is converted into energy at a state-of-the art, waste-to-energy facility. Crown was also able to reduce plant usage by six percent. Additionally, the New Knoxville plant now uses 30 percent recycled-content paper and environmentally friendly cleaners. The facility later received ISO 14001 certification in January 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;One of the most important steps in achieving zero landfill status and receiving ISO 14001 certification is creating an open channel for internal communication. To a great extent, achieving these types of goals depends on the level of employee buy-in and involvement,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Duffy, director of corporate environmental and manufacturing safety at Crown Equipment Corporation. &amp;ldquo;This award could not have been achieved without the hard work and dedication of the New Knoxville plant employees. They took ownership of the initiative and kept the momentum going.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tonja Hardin, Crown environmental administrator, accepted the award on Crown&amp;rsquo;s behalf, along with plant employees Troy Flenar, Paula Fischer and Dorothy Winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Crown&amp;rsquo;s commitment to environmental sustainability is evident throughout numerous aspects of its operations. The company releases an annual Crown ecologic Report highlighting the company&amp;rsquo;s sustainability initiatives and accomplishments.

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Ohio Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Since 1986, the Ohio EPA has coordinated the Annual Governor&amp;rsquo;s Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Pollution Prevention to recognize companies and organizations that have made outstanding achievement in reducing pollution through source reduction of the recycling of waste. Ultimately, these efforts help protect Ohio&amp;rsquo;s environment and public health. In 2008, the Awards were renamed the Ohio Awards for Outstanding Achievement in Environmental Stewardship to broaden the program&amp;rsquo;s scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Crown Equipment Corporation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Crown is one of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest lift truck manufacturers. Crown&amp;rsquo;s award-winning line of lift trucks maintains a reputation for exceptional product design, engineering and manufacturing. From the smallest hand pallet truck to the highest lifting turret truck, Crown seeks to provide users with safe, efficient and ergonomic lift trucks that lower total cost of ownership and maximize uptime.

            <title>EPA analysis shows reduction in toxic chemical releases</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its annual national analysis of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), providing all Americans vital information about their communities. The TRI program publishes information on toxic chemical disposals and releases into the air, land and water, as well as information on waste management and pollution prevention activities in neighborhoods across the country. In 2009, 3.37 billion pounds of toxic chemicals were released into the environment, a 12 percent decrease from 2008. TRI was recently recognized by the Aspen Institute as one of the 10 major ways that EPA has strengthened America.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Toxics Release Inventory is an important way to inform American communities about their local environmental conditions. It plays a critical role in EPA&amp;rsquo;s efforts to hold polluters accountable and to acknowledge good corporate neighbors who put pollution prevention efforts in place,&amp;rdquo; said EPA administrator Lisa P. Jackson. &amp;ldquo;We will continue to make every effort to put accessible, meaningful information in the hands of the American people. Widespread public access to environmental information is fundamental to the work EPA does every day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	This year, EPA is offering additional information to make the TRI data more meaningful and accessible to all communities. The TRI analysis now highlights toxic disposals and releases to large aquatic ecosystems, selected urban communities, and tribal lands. In addition, portions of the analysis are available in Spanish for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The analysis, which includes data on approximately 650 chemicals from more than 20,000 facilities, found that total releases to air decreased 20 percent since 2008, while releases to surface water decreased 18 percent. Releases to land decreased 4 percent since 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The analysis shows decreases in the releases of persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic chemicals including lead, dioxin, and mercury. Total disposal or other releases of mercury decreased 3 percent since 2008, while total disposal or other releases of both dioxin and lead decreased by 18 percent. The analysis also shows a 7 percent decrease in the number of facilities reporting to TRI from the previous year, continuing a trend from the past few years. Some of this decline may be attributed to the economic downturn; however, EPA plans to investigate why some facilities reported in 2008 but not 2009.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA added 16 chemicals to the TRI list of reportable chemicals in November. These chemicals are reasonably anticipated to be human carcinogens, and represent the largest chemical expansion of the program in a decade. Data on the new TRI chemicals will be reported by facilities on July 1, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Facilities must report their chemical disposals and releases by July 1 of each year. This year, EPA made the 2009 preliminary TRI dataset available in July, the same month as the data were collected. This is the earliest release of TRI data to the public ever.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TRI was established in 1986 by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA) and later modified by the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. Together, these laws require facilities in certain industries to report annually on releases, disposal and other waste management activities related to these chemicals. TRI data are submitted annually to EPA and states by multiple industry sectors including manufacturing, metal mining, electric utilities, and commercial hazardous waste facilities.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Ford's Michigan Assembly to build gas-powered, electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company&amp;rsquo;s Michigan Assembly Plant, which once churned out large SUVs, has completed a $550 million transformation that will make it the world&amp;rsquo;s first factory to build not only fuel-efficient gas-powered cars, but also three production versions of electrified vehicles including battery electric, hybrid and plug-in hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michigan Assembly will be home to the all-new global Ford Focus, which has started production and goes on sale early next year. The Focus Electric zero-emission battery electric vehicle goes into production late next year followed by production of a new hybrid and a plug-in hybrid in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;ve modernized just about every square foot of this facility to establish a new standard for a high-tech, green, flexible and efficient auto factory,&amp;rdquo; said Jim Tetreault, Ford vice president of North America Manufacturing. &amp;ldquo;The transformation of Michigan Assembly Plant stands as a symbol for the transformation of Ford.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the outside, a new 500-kilowatt solar panel system will be installed to help generate renewal energy for production of Ford&amp;rsquo;s all-new Focus and Focus Electric cars. Ten new electric vehicle charging stations on the property will be used to recharge the electric trucks that transport parts between adjacent facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Inside, new cars making the three-mile trip down the assembly line must pass dozens of rigorous quality inspections. A new three-wet paint booth utilizes 66 paint robots with seven axis of movement to precisely apply paint to the cars. In the body shop, 500 new robots capable of 4,000 welds per vehicle add to the plant&amp;rsquo;s flexibility. And a new internal communications system flashes updates and information to the plant&amp;rsquo;s 3,200 employees via 163 monitor screens distributed throughout the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Flexible: Trends move fast &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Bright, modern and green &amp;ndash; like the car it is building &amp;ndash; the refurbished Michigan Assembly Plant is the company&amp;rsquo;s new benchmark for flexible manufacturing. At 1.2 million square feet &amp;ndash; about the size of 22 football fields &amp;ndash; the plant becomes Ford&amp;rsquo;s most flexible, high-volume and modern manufacturing facility in its global operations.&amp;nbsp; Ford will continue to evolve its manufacturing flexibility as the company&amp;rsquo;s facilities are rapidly being transformed into more nimble, flexible, and technologically advanced operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The changes at the plant will allow the company to run multiple models down the same production line without requiring considerable downtime for changeover of tooling. Two different models of the Focus can be adjusted between builds without restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If the last few years have taught us anything, it is that customer wants and needs can change quickly &amp;ndash; much more quickly than we have been equipped to efficiently respond to in the past,&amp;rdquo; said Tetreault. &amp;ldquo;At Michigan Assembly, we will achieve a level of flexibility we don&amp;rsquo;t have in any other plant around the world, which will allow us to meet shifting consumer preferences in real time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Renewable: Power from the sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Michigan Assembly also will boast Michigan&amp;rsquo;s largest solar power generation system and several electric vehicle charging stations for greener, more sustainable manufacturing when installation is completed next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford is teaming with Detroit Edison and Xtreme Power to install the 500-kilowatt solar photovoltaic panel system. The system will be integrated with a 750-kilowatt energy storage facility that can store 2 million watt-hours of energy using batteries &amp;ndash; enough to power 100 average Michigan homes for a year. A secondary, smaller solar energy system will be added at a later date to power lighting systems at Michigan Assembly. The combined systems are expected to result in projected energy cost savings of about $160,000 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Quality: At every turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	To ensure best-in-class quality for the all-new Focus, vehicles on the line will endure rigorous examinations. Workers will perform hundreds of comprehensive quality tests and checks to ensure every bolt, seam and joint has been thoroughly inspected before continuing down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are leveraging our people, processes and products to consistently build cars that will surpass the competition,&amp;rdquo; said Tetreault. &amp;ldquo;This plant embodies everything we as a company strive to become &amp;ndash; modern, efficient, flexible, global and sustainable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Contributing to Focus&amp;rsquo; best-in-class quality and Michigan Assembly&amp;rsquo;s transformation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Virtual manufacturing technology to improve ergonomics for easier, safer work&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Redesigned water soak testing booth to ensure zero water entry for long-term durability&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Highly efficient and environmentally friendly painting process&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Best-in-class squeak and rattle track that shakes and rolls vehicles for noises&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New energy-efficient illumination lighting for better vehicle inspections&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Moving platforms with real-time height adjustments for better operator ergonomics&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Vision-guided automation for better installation, fit-and-finish of doors, decks and hoods&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		New robotic paint spray booths for more consistent and environmentally friendly application&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Electric tools capable of precisely measuring torque and the number of rotations required to secure bolts, screws and other attachments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Adding to the physical transformation of the plant, Ford and the United Auto Workers have developed a framework to establish a strong, progressive culture that encourages joint problem solving and continuous improvement of the production process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This plant is an inspirational example of how a modern manufacturing facility should look and work,&amp;rdquo; said Tetreault. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s bright, high-tech and efficient, while also being environmentally and ergonomically friendly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>General Motors surpasses landfill-free facilities commitment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors said December 13 that 52 percent of its worldwide facilities are now landfill-free, meaning all waste generated from normal operations is reused, recycled or converted to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM now has 76 landfill-free facilities, achieving a global operations commitment established in 2008 to convert 50 percent of its 145 plants to landfill-free status by the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re committed to reducing our environmental impact,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Mike Robinson&lt;/span&gt;, vice president of Environment, Energy and Safety Policy at GM. &amp;quot;Whether it&amp;#39;s a facility that&amp;#39;s already achieved landfill-free status or one of the many that are nearly there, every site is serious about finding ways to reduce and reuse waste.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM employees focus first on decreasing the amount of waste generated, and then work to recycle the unavoidable waste. This year alone, GM has recycled or reused 2.5 million tons of waste materials at its plants worldwide &amp;ndash; enough to fill 6.8 million extended-cab pickup trucks that, if parked end-to-end, would stretch around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through this annual recycling rate, it is estimated that GM has eliminated 8.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from entering the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all about being creative, lean and rethinking traditional manufacturing processes,&amp;quot; said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;John Bradburn&lt;/span&gt;, manager of GM&amp;#39;s waste-reduction efforts. &amp;quot;When you think of what it would take for a family of four to not produce any trash for a year, that&amp;#39;s quite a task. This is 76 sites around the world and about 70,000 employees committed to the cause.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM&amp;#39;s first facility to achieve landfill-free status was an engine plant in &lt;span class="xn-location"&gt;Flint, Mich.&lt;/span&gt;, in 2005. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM plants monitor, measure and report monthly on how they perform against waste-reduction goals. This data, which set the stage for the landfill-free initiative, shows what materials are being generated, reused and recycled, and reveals areas for improvement. The resulting insight helped form a process that enables facilities to replicate best practices globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On average, more than 97 percent of waste materials from GM&amp;#39;s zero-landfill plants are recycled or reused and less than 3 percent is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities, replacing fossil fuels. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;I believe our employees were willing to engage because they could relate to what it means,&amp;quot; said Bradburn. &amp;quot;People don&amp;#39;t want to be wasteful; they want to help the environment. It&amp;#39;s become a sense of pride for those that work at those facilities, and it reflects in quality and throughput.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Said &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Larry Chalfan&lt;/span&gt;, founder and now senior adviser of the &lt;a href="http://www.zerowaste.org/"&gt;Zero Waste Alliance&lt;/a&gt;: &amp;quot;This is another environmental leadership move for GM. In all of my experience, there are few companies that have taken zero waste to this level. GM&amp;#39;s workforce &amp;ndash; from the assembly line to the executives -- should be recognized for their dedication and commitment to be efficient and reduce their environmental impact.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Critical to the landfill-free designation is the ability for GM to turn material byproducts from routine manufacturing operations into new-vehicle components. &amp;nbsp;Plant managers view this waste as potentially useful and marketable, and they work with their teams and suppliers to develop these closed-loop systems. Other operational waste comes full circle, as well, and is often recycled into plant supplies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Examples include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul type="disc"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Cardboard shipping materials from the GM &lt;span class="xn-person"&gt;Marion Stamping&lt;/span&gt; and Fort Wayne Assembly plants are recycled into sound-absorber material in the Buick Lacrosse&amp;#39;s headliner.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Plastic caps and shipping aids from the Fort Wayne facility are converted into radiator shrouds for the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups built at the plant.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Tires from vehicle performance testing at Milford Proving Ground are shredded and used in the manufacturing of air and water baffles for a variety of GM vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Paint sludge from the Lansing Grand River plant is turned into plastic material and used for shipping containers durable enough to hold Chevrolet Volt and Cruze engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In addition to the environmental benefits, recycling provides a strong business case,&amp;quot; said Robinson. &amp;quot;GM has generated more than &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$2.5 billion&lt;/span&gt; in revenue since 2007 through its various recycling activities.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, metals from stamping and powertrain operations are valuable, especially considering the amount GM generates. What metal grindings and scraps GM doesn&amp;#39;t re-melt or reuse are sold to third parties like foundries. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM was one of the first organizations &amp;ndash; and to date is the only auto manufacturer &amp;ndash; inducted into the U.S. EPA WasteWise Hall of Fame, which recognizes continued outstanding waste reduction. GM&amp;#39;s worldwide facilities combined recycle 90 percent of the waste they generate. The company has reduced total non-recycled waste 75 percent between 2000 and 2010 at manufacturing sites around the world. During the last five years, it decreased waste generated per vehicle by 28 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM has made great progress in reducing its environmental impact. In November, Chevrolet announced a &lt;a href="http://www.chevycarbonreduction.com/"&gt;multi-year commitment&lt;/a&gt; to invest &lt;span class="xn-money"&gt;$40 million&lt;/span&gt; in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce another 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/XbXX6ZMH3b4" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Manufacturing group call EPA delays a step in right direction</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Keith McCoy, the National Association of Manufacturers&amp;rsquo; vice president of energy and resources policy, issued the following statement December 8 regarding the Environmental Protection Agency&amp;rsquo;s (EPA) announcements that it will seek an extension to re-propose the Boiler MACT rule and will delay reconsideration of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We welcome the EPA&amp;rsquo;s decision to delay its final rules on both the Boiler MACT and ozone NAAQS. Clearly, the agency has heard the calls from manufacturers to thoroughly analyze the achievability and economic impact of these expensive and complex proposals. The EPA&amp;rsquo;s aggressive drive to put costly new burdens on manufacturers continues to create uncertainty and harm manufacturers&amp;rsquo; ability to compete in the global economy. We hope this week&amp;rsquo;s announcements signal that the EPA is slowing down on overly burdensome and unnecessary rules that will crush economic growth and job creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Recent studies show the negative impact of the EPA&amp;rsquo;s current path and proposals. A study by the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI finds the EPA&amp;rsquo;s proposed ozone standards would cost 7.3 million jobs by 2020 and add $1 trillion in new regulatory costs per year between 2020 and 2030. A study by the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners (CIBO) finds the EPA&amp;rsquo;s proposed rules to restrict emission limits on industrial and commercial boilers and process heaters could put 300,000 jobs at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our nation&amp;rsquo;s unemployment rate is 9.8 percent. We need more jobs, not more job-killing proposals. Manufacturers also urge the EPA to reconsider other costly and unattainable proposals, such as the greenhouse gas regulations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The National Association of Manufacturers is the largest manufacturing association in the United States, representing manufacturers in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. Manufacturing has a presence in every single congressional district providing good, high-paying jobs.

            <title>Logan Aluminum agrees to resolve allegations of Clean Air Act violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Department of Justice on behalf of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, along with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, have filed a complaint and entered into a consent decree with Logan Aluminum Inc. to settle alleged violations of the Clean Air Act&amp;rsquo;s National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for Secondary Aluminum Production occurring at Logan Aluminum&amp;rsquo;s Russellville, Ky., secondary aluminum facility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The proposed consent decree resolves claims of the United States and the commonwealth under the Clean Air Act and related provisions of the laws of the commonwealth. Under the terms of the decree, Logan Aluminum will pay a civil penalty of $285,000 and install a pollution control device called a baghouse for one of its furnace&amp;rsquo;s capture/collection systems. The civil penalty is the second highest to be negotiated in dealing with a single facility for violations of the Clean Air Act&amp;rsquo;s secondary aluminum production regulations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Logan Aluminum manufactures aluminum coils which are used in the beverage industry. Part of the production process for these coils causes emissions of potential pollutants such as dioxins and furans, hydrogen chloride and particulate matter.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The complaint was filed and the consent decree lodged contemporaneously in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky on December 8, 2010. Notice of the lodging of the consent decree will appear in the Federal Register allowing for a 30-day public comment period before the consent decree can be entered by the court as final judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/6FZ7r9baTQE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE survey uncovers who is most likely to buy an electric vehicle</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/just-what-will-nudge-more-consumers-to-buy-evs/" jquery1291833508320="8"&gt;Behavioral economist&amp;rsquo;s Dan Ariely&amp;rsquo;s view&lt;/a&gt; on what will nudge more consumers to buy electric vehicles dovetails with GE&amp;rsquo;s own quantitative look at buying habits. Over the summer, a third-party research firm working with GE asked just over 1,000 consumers to share their thoughts on EVs. About half of the sample were drivers with gas-powered cars, the other half currently drive a hybrid or EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The survey found that drivers have three key needs when it comes to considering an EV purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;Environmentally Conscious&amp;rdquo; respondents see EVs as symbolizing their commitment to the planet, sustainability, and fossil fuel independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg1-lg.jpg" jquery1291833508320="9" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg1-sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;ldquo;Technology and Car Driven&amp;rdquo; consumers make a different statement. Environmental benefits aside, they see the technology as simply &amp;ldquo;cool&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; representing cutting edge innovation that puts them ahead of the pack. In tech circles, they&amp;rsquo;re known as &amp;ldquo;early adopters.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="2"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg2-lg.jpg" jquery1291833508320="10" sizcache="3" sizset="2"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg2-sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Wow factor:&lt;/span&gt; Click to enlarge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Frugal Travelers&amp;rdquo; rounded out the group, with EVs seen as a way to permanently reduce their travel costs &amp;mdash; with the added benefit of being environmentally friendly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="3"&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg3-lg.jpg" jquery1291833508320="11" sizcache="3" sizset="3"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/seg-3sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Wallets matter:&lt;/span&gt; Click to enlarge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As for those that are ready to buy an EV, a recent Deloitte study found the top three considerations when purchasing an EV are vehicle price, reliability and cost to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Although charging costs can vary based on the electrical grid infrastructure, GE estimates a full charge for a 24 kWh battery using its &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-unveils-residential-wattstation-ev-charger/" jquery1291833508320="12"&gt;new WattStation charger&lt;/a&gt; will cost approximately $3.50 &amp;ndash; $4.00, based on average electricity rates.And smart grid time-of-use pricing programs will allow customers to charge their vehicle at an even more efficient rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/bAbHpoNKjZ0" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>AK Steel receives Honda's Green Factory Environmental Achievement Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	AK Steel has received Honda&amp;rsquo;s Green Factory Environmental Achievement Award in the category of Conservation of Natural Resources. The award recognizes the company for its ongoing environmental restoration efforts at its steel plant in Coshocton, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Through its actions, AK Steel is showing the importance of land stewardship and how it can benefit society while also providing a rich habitat for diverse native plants and animals,&amp;quot; said Rich Spivey, senior manager in Honda&amp;#39;s North American Purchasing Division. &amp;quot;This award recognizes AK Steel&amp;#39;s commitment to restore and protect a unique natural environment in its local community.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since the summer of 2008, AK Steel has restored more than 10 acres of property at its Coshocton Works into native Ohio prairie land. The area includes several nesting boxes for bluebirds and purple martins, as well as native flowers and grasses. The company said it will maintain the restored area and plans to expand the prairie to more than 20 acres over time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;AK Steel is proud to receive Honda&amp;rsquo;s Green Factory Environmental Achievement Award,&amp;rdquo; said James L. Wainscott, chairman, president and CEO of AK Steel. &amp;ldquo;This recognition reflects our commitment to operating responsibly at Coshocton Works and all of our plant locations.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda&amp;rsquo;s Green Factory Achievement Awards recognize environmental stewardship among Honda&amp;#39;s nearly 600 parts suppliers in North America, and reflect Honda&amp;#39;s ongoing commitments to protect the environment through its products and its operations. Through this awards program and the participation by many suppliers at its annual environmental symposium, Honda&amp;nbsp;encourages all suppliers to achieve excellence in environmental management and land stewardship. The award is presented to companies each year based on their achievements in three areas: Conservation of natural resources, energy reduction and pollution prevention. AK Steel participated in the symposium this year by presenting its environmental restoration initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to receiving Honda&amp;rsquo;s Green Factory Award, AK Steel&amp;rsquo;s Coshocton Works received &amp;ldquo;Wildlife at Work&amp;rdquo; certification in 2009 from the Wildlife Habitat Council, a leading non-profit organization dedicated to restoring and enhancing wildlife habitat. AK Steel uses high efficiency lighting throughout its Coshocton facility, and all of the company&amp;rsquo;s plants are ANSI / ISO 14001:2004 certified to meet internationally recognized environmental management standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About AK Steel &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	AK Steel produces flat-rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels, primarily for automotive, appliance, construction and electrical power generation and distribution markets. The company employs about 6,200 men and women in Middletown, Mansfield, Coshocton and Zanesville, Ohio; Butler, Pa.; Ashland, Ky.; Rockport, Ind.; and its corporate headquarters in West Chester, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/SB4KkUh-e0U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Ford, Azure Dynamics mark production and delivery of first Transit Connect Electrics</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company and Azure Dynamics have begun shipping the first Ford Transit Connect Electrics to early customers in North America and to the United Kingdom for a demonstration project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The all-electric commercial vans, built on the Ford Transit Connect vehicle body, equipped with Azure Dynamics&amp;rsquo; patented Force Drive&amp;trade; battery electric powertrain, and assembled by AM General at its facility in Livonia, Mich., are reaching the market 13 months after the collaboration to develop the zero-emission vehicle was first announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, all initial units have designated customers. Azure Dynamics&amp;rsquo; LEAD customer program includes seven companies that are taking delivery of their first units in 2010, with the remainder of their orders to be filled in 2011. Customers that have been previously announced include AT&amp;amp;T, Southern California Edison, Xcel Energy, Johnson Controls Inc., New York Power Authority, Canada Post and Toronto Atmospheric Fund EV300. Additional LEAD customers will be identified by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford first announced the collaboration in October 2009, with an agreement for Azure Dynamics to upfit the Transit Connect van with Azure&amp;rsquo;s Force Drive battery electric drivetrain technology including Johnson Controls-Saft&amp;rsquo;s advanced lithium-ion battery, and a commitment to deliver the initial vehicles by the end of 2010 to the North American market. Initial production began in the fourth quarter of 2010 with full production of the Transit Connect Electric slated to ramp up in April 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Supplier collaboration is important on all Ford product programs, but it was especially key in this effort, which went from contract signing to vehicle production in 13 months,&amp;rdquo; said Sherif Marakby, Ford director, Electrification Programs and Engineering. &amp;ldquo;A strong teamwork environment established by Azure and Ford was critical to delivering this vehicle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Transit Connect Electric program is a great representation of our product development approach,&amp;rdquo; said Scott Harrison, CEO, Azure Dynamics. &amp;ldquo;We have been able to focus on integration of our Force Drive powertrain solution and benefit from Ford&amp;rsquo;s expertise in building ground-up global vehicle platforms. Meanwhile, capital costs are kept in check by contracting AM General for labor and assembly services &amp;ndash; an area where the company excels. Transit Connect Electric is a revolutionary technology and achieving our aggressive time line is a testament to the professionalism and spirit of cooperation among all the project partners.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Michigan Economic Development Corporation provided incentive funding for Azure Dynamics to encourage selection of a Michigan-based partner for final assembly. Azure chose AM General LLC, to produce the Transit Connect Electric in its facility in Livonia, Mich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AM General, a long-established contract vehicle assembler and services provider, is responsible for final upfit of the Transit Connect Electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Transit Connect Electric is the first product in Ford&amp;rsquo;s accelerated electrified vehicle plan, and will be followed by the Focus Electric passenger car in 2011, along with a plug-in hybrid electric and two next-generation lithium-ion battery-powered hybrid vehicles in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultra-Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to delivery of units to LEAD customers in North America, the Transit Connect Electric commercial van is headed to the United Kingdom, where 14 of the vehicles will take part in the government&amp;rsquo;s Ultra-Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator program. The program, supported by Scottish and Southern Energy, utilizes a fleet of zero-emissions vehicles for the energy company, with designated drivers to test vehicle and infrastructure technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The consortium of Ford, Scottish and Southern Energy and the University of Strathclyde will provide Transit Connect Electric vehicles and a charging infrastructure in and around the London suburb of Hillingdon during 2010 and 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford and Azure Dynamics already have announced they will collaborate to produce the Transit Connect Electric for the European market with first units to be delivered in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Designed with Fleet Users in Mind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The all-electric, zero-emissions Transit Connect Electric has a driving range of up to 80 miles per full charge and is ideal for fleet owners who have well-defined routes of predictable distances and a central location for daily recharging. Delivery fleet and utility vehicle operators have begun to show a preference for smaller, more efficient vehicles, which creates an ideal time for Transit Connect Electric to come to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Transit Connect provides a unique choice for the fleet owner who wants the convenience of a utility vehicle,&amp;rdquo; Marakby said. &amp;ldquo;The electric version takes that one step further, delivering a dependable, zero-tailpipe-emission vehicle that requires no petroleum.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Owners will have the option of recharging Transit Connect Electric with either a standard 120-volt outlet, or preferably a 240-volt charge station, typically installed at the user&amp;rsquo;s base of operations for optimal recharging in six to eight hours. A transportable cord that works with both types of outlets will be available for convenient recharging at either voltage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vehicle&amp;rsquo;s charge port is located above the passenger-side rear wheel well. The onboard liquid-cooled 28-kilowatt-hour lithium-ion battery pack is charged by connecting the charge port to a power outlet. Inside the vehicle, an onboard charger converts AC power from the electric grid to DC power to charge the battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Transit Connect Electric is expected to offer lower cost of operation, because charging with electricity is generally less expensive than fueling with gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When the vehicle is operating, battery power is provided to the drive motor through the electric powertrain&amp;rsquo;s motor controller. The motor controller uses throttle input from the driver to convert DC power supplied by the battery into three precisely timed signals used to drive the motor. The onboard DC/DC converter allows the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s main battery pack to charge the onboard 12-volt battery, which powers the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s various accessories, such as headlights, power steering and coolant pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In Transit Connect Electric, the battery pack has been efficiently integrated without compromising interior passenger room and cargo space. The Johnson Controls-Saft battery pack is expected to last the life of the vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First in Ford&amp;rsquo;s Overall Electrified Vehicle Strategy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The electrification strategy builds on Ford&amp;rsquo;s vision for bringing affordable technology to millions. It takes advantage of rapid advancements in electrified vehicle technology &amp;ndash; particularly lithium-ion batteries &amp;ndash; while leveraging the scale of global vehicle platforms to bring the cost of new technology down.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>P&amp;G announces first N.A. plant to achieve zero waste to landfill</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Procter &amp;amp; Gamble Company on December 6 announced that its Auburn, Maine, site became the first P&amp;amp;G manufacturing plant in North America to achieve zero waste to landfill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The feminine care facility worked with both employees and suppliers to implement a process that beneficially uses 100 percent of its waste. A majority &amp;ndash; more than 60 percent &amp;ndash; is recycled or reused, while the remainder is converted to energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The P&amp;amp;G Global Asset Recovery Purchases (GARP) team &amp;ndash; charged with finding external partners that can turn waste and non-performing inventory into something useful &amp;ndash; connected the plant with a site solution provider, who helped sort all recyclable materials and convert existing non-recyclable materials to energy through incineration. The electricity from incineration is used by the incineration facility and the excess is sold to the local power company. The GARP team has diverted tens of thousands of tons from landfills while delivering tens of millions of dollars in cost recovery to the company in the past year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Auburn&amp;#39;s success is the latest milestone in our continued global effort to achieve zero manufacturing waste sent to landfill,&amp;quot; said Len Sauers, P&amp;amp;G vice president of global sustainability. &amp;quot;GARP is a terrific example of how internal innovation and external partnerships have joined to help realize the company&amp;#39;s sustainability vision and goals.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Auburn is the ninth P&amp;amp;G global manufacturing plant to earn this distinction. Some of the other sites that have achieved this status include our Fabric and Home Care site in Belgium, Beauty &amp;amp; Grooming site in the United Kingdom, Feminine Care site in Hungary and Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The achievement of these sites to reach zero waste to landfill demonstrates continued progress toward P&amp;amp;G&amp;#39;s long-term environmental vision. This vision includes having zero manufacturing waste globally going to landfills, instead being beneficially reused and ending up in valued waste streams. The company also has a goal to achieve less than 0.5 percent disposed manufacturing waste by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Procter &amp;amp; Gamble &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Four billion times a day, P&amp;amp;G brands touch the lives of people around the world. The company has one of the strongest portfolios of trusted, quality, leadership brands, including Pampers, Tide, Ariel, Always, Whisper, Pantene, Mach3, Bounty, Dawn, Gain, Pringles, Charmin, Downy, Lenor, Iams, Crest, Oral-B, Duracell, Olay, Head &amp;amp; Shoulders, Wella, Gillette, Braun and Fusion. The P&amp;amp;G community includes approximately 127,000 employees working in about 80 countries worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/mXDeVdw1zVA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota technology shortens process to improve sugar cane</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announced that, based on joint development with the National Agricultural Research Center for Kyushu Okinawa Region (KONARC), it has created genetic-analysis technology that can substantially shorten the time needed to improve varieties of sugar cane and improve plant performance.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC developed a high-throughput DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) analysis technology, based on which KONARC assessed sugar cane performance and TMC worked on genetic analysis. Combining the results created the new genetic-analysis technology.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Conventional agricultural plant improvement involves selecting and crossing parent varieties based on extensive past performance data, assessing progeny over the long term, and selecting new progeny with the desired property. In place of this, a revolutionary crop-improving technology &amp;ndash; marker-assisted breeding &amp;ndash; uses genetic information to predict performance and has been used in breeding rice and maize. However, sugar cane&amp;#39;s large genome size makes it difficult to genetically analyze, meaning marker-assisted breeding cannot easily be applied.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In response, TMC developed its high-throughput DNA analysis technology based on DNA microarray technology that allows highly precise, high-throughput genotyping. With its new technology, TMC successfully created a sugar-cane genetic map five times more accurate than previous maps, making it possible to identify the positions of genes and to use that information to create better sugar cane.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC believes the development of the new genetic-analysis technology will constitute a major step toward achieving the goal of shortening the period needed for sugar-cane improvement by 50% and expects it will lead to increased sugar-cane yield through creating sugar-cane varieties with higher sugar content and improved disease resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	TMC and KONARC will present the new genetic-analysis technology at the 33rd annual meeting of the Molecular Biology Society of Japan to be held in Kobe from December 7.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC has been developing technologies to increase crop yield with the aim of supporting the expanded use of bio-fuels. The high-throughput DNA analysis technology that forms the core of the genetic-analysis technology announced today can be applied to not only sugar cane but to other varieties of plants that have a large genome. TMC believes that its high-throughput DNA analysis technology also holds potential foodstuff-production and environmental advantages. To enable broad use of this technology, TMC plans to make information concerning it open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/N8nzZH9Ut0M" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GM receives Energy and Environmental Excellence Award</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	General Motors received an Energy and Environmental Excellence Award from Hart Energy Publishing, recognizing the company&amp;rsquo;s progress toward the sustainable use of global natural resources and reducing its environmental footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The award was presented Thursday at the &amp;ldquo;Meeting the Clean Fuels Challenge&amp;rdquo; conference in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We work hard to reduce our environmental impact throughout all of our business practices from sustainable facilities and greener vehicles to recycling and reusing materials,&amp;rdquo; said Mike Robinson, vice president of environment, energy and safety policy at GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When designing new vehicles, GM engineers use materials from renewable resources whenever economically and technically possible. Materials come from many sources, including old soft drink bottles, nylon carpet, used tires and recycled vehicle bumpers. For example, the 2011 Chevrolet Cruze&amp;rsquo;s sound insulation material is made from recycled blue jeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of their lifecycles, GM vehicles are at least 85 percent recyclable and 95 percent recoverable by weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Energy and Environmental Excellence Award comes on the heels of a recent &lt;a href="http://www.chevycarbonreduction.com/" target="_blank"&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; by Chevrolet to invest $40 million in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The company also received industry accolades for its Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle with extended range, including &lt;a href="http://bit.ly/bvRejH" target="_blank"&gt;Green Car of the Year&lt;/a&gt; by Green Car Journal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hart Energy Publishing provides specialized data/information products and member-only services to targeted audiences worldwide and ranks among the leading providers of news, data and analysis for the global energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/NwmoTE32fAA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Cargill exceeds greenhouse gas emission reduction targets</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill has exceeded the Chicago Climate Exchange&amp;#39;s (CCX) required 5 percent greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) reduction target for calendar year 2009 (the latest reporting year for which the data has been verified). Cargill reduced its GHG emissions at its U.S. facilities by 12 percent. During calendar year 2008, Cargill achieved a 7.8 percent reduction. Cargill has now met every annual CCX reduction milestone since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cargill made a voluntary but legally binding commitment to reduce absolute GHG emissions from its primary U.S. locations by joining the Chicago Climate Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While the slow economy had a role in 2009, Cargill also credits the progress to efforts to improve energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources at its corn milling, meat, salt and oilseeds facilities throughout the United States For example, at its beef and pork plants, Cargill reclaims methane from its waste water lagoons and turns it into biogas to fuel its plant boilers. Biogas now displaces 20 to 25 percent of natural gas demand at all eight of Cargill&amp;#39;s U.S. meat processing plants. And Cargill is also implementing behavior-based energy savings programs, a system which engages employees in recognizing and eliminating energy inefficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Climate change is a priority for Cargill, our customers, our stakeholders and the communities in which we do business,&amp;quot; said Cargill environment, health and safety vice president LaRaye Osborne. &amp;quot;As part of these efforts, we are actively engaged in supporting development of efficient carbon trading markets and in building understanding of the relationship of climate change and agricultural and food systems.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Cargill&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Cargill is an international producer and marketer of food, agricultural, financial, and industrial products and services. Founded in 1865, the privately held company employs 131,000 people in 66 countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/pXULlfEKvPg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>100% electric zero-emission Nissan LEAF debuts in Japan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company Ltd. on December 3 announced the launch of the all-new 100 percent&amp;nbsp;electric, zero-emission Nissan LEAF, which goes on sale December 20 at Nissan dealers throughout Japan. It will be followed by the United States, also in December, and in select European markets in early 2011. Release in other global markets is set for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="imgLayout01"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="Nissan LEAF G" src="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2010/_STORY/101203-01-01.jpg" /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;strong&gt;Nissan LEAF G&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF is a newly developed EV designed for the mass market, offering new mobility for a sustainable zero-emission society. Achieving outstanding environmental performance as a zero-emission vehicle with no tailpipe emissions, including CO&lt;span class="small01"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;2&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, Nissan LEAF is powered by a lithium-ion battery and an electric motor. It provides unique driving experience, delivering strong, smooth acceleration performance and quietness comparable to luxury vehicles in every speed range. It also offers superior handling stability realized by its excellent weight balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As a specifically designed electric vehicle, Nissan LEAF supports the comfortable life and completely new values that an EV provides. With enough interior space to accommodate five adults, Nissan LEAF features a driving range of 200 km (on JC08 mode), enough to satisfy the needs of most customers. Nissan LEAF also utilizes an advanced IT system, providing customers with convenient functional support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The price of Nissan LEAF starts from 3,764,250 yen, including the consumption tax. Since customers in Japan are eligible to receive up to 780,000 yen through government EV incentives for fiscal year 2010, the consumer&amp;#39;s net price for Nissan LEAF starts from 2,984,250 yen. Nissan LEAF also qualifies for preferential tax breaks under the Japanese &amp;quot;tax system to promote the diffusion of environmentally friendly vehicles&amp;quot; as next generation automobiles, thereby fully exempting it from the automobile acquisition tax and automobile weight tax until fiscal year 2011. Since it also qualifies for the &amp;quot;Automobile Green Tax Scheme,&amp;quot; the automobile tax is reduced by 50% for one year starting from the next fiscal year following registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To help ensure comfortable, convenient and safe use of the new EV, Nissan offers a &amp;quot;Nissan zero-emission Support Program&amp;quot; for individual customers. The program which includes EV-IT communication charge, maintenance support such as regular inspections and the first car safety inspection, charging at Nissan dealers, discount service for Nissan Rentacar and emergency support in case of trouble - at the monthly rate of 1,500 yen. For corporate customers, Nissan provides &amp;quot;Nissan EV Fleet Maintenance Service.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan dealers nationwide also provide &amp;quot;one-stop service&amp;quot; - from vehicle purchase to arranging for the preparation of a charging environment for detached houses. In addition, 200-volt normal charging is available at about 2,200 Nissan dealers nationwide. About 200 of these dealers are equipped with quick chargers that can charge the battery up to 80% of its full capacity in about 30 minutes. At least one quick-charge unit is available within a 40-kilometer radius throughout the country for the convenience of Nissan LEAF drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the goal of becoming a global leader in zero-emission mobility, Nissan, in conjunction with Renault, has signed more than 80 partnerships for zero-emission mobility with governments, municipalities and companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;
	Key features of the new Nissan LEAF are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Zero-emission&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unique driving experience&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Always &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 class="newsTitle"&gt;
	Overview of Nissan LEAF&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		An advanced EV powertrain that supports &amp;quot;zero-emission&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;The all-new Nissan LEAF is designed to provide &amp;quot;unique driving experience&amp;quot; with extraordinary acceleration performance, quietness and handling stability. Key powertrain components include:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;High capacity lithium-ion battery (storage battery)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Vehicle performance, cost and interior comfort are greatly affected by the battery. Nissan LEAF adopts a lightweight, compact, high-capacity lithium-ion battery that achieves double the energy density compared to a conventional EV battery (such as used on the Nissan Hypermini, which was first released in February 2000). Delivering 24 kWh battery capacity and maximum power output of more than 90 kWh, a full charge provides a driving range of 200 km (on JC08 mode).&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s advanced battery design utilizes a thin, compact laminated cell structure. The simple configuration of the individual cells, the smallest unit of the battery, allows a high battery capacity - along with very practical and flexible packaging without sacrificing interior comfort. Since the laminated cells have a large surface area and excellent cooling performance, stable performance is ensured in various usage environments. The structure also reduces cost through less parts complexity.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Since manganese, which is used for positive electrode, is an abundant resource, with stable spinel structure, low cost and high reliability are ensured.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The battery pack is fitted below the floorboard at the center of the body, providing superior weight balance and a low center of gravity. In addition to enhancing body rigidity, this helps provide responsive handling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Electric motor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A three-phase AC synchronous motor delivering maximum power output of 80kW and maximum torque of 280Nã»m is used, which can instantly generate maximum torque from a starting position. With Nissan&amp;#39;s proprietary motor control technology, strong continuous acceleration with instantaneous force - which cannot be provided by a gasoline vehicle - is realized. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s acceleration performance in the low-to-medium speed range is equivalent to that of a 3.0-liter gasoline engine vehicle, and offers a maximum speed of 145km/h.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Unlike a gasoline engine, no vibrations are generated by the electric motor. This, along with and adoption of superior noise insulation technology, helps Nissan LEAF achieve extraordinary quiet operation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When the vehicle is decelerating, part of the braking energy is regenerated as electric power. This energy can be reused with this system.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Inverter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The inverter controls power output from the motor by controlling the current, converting direct current into alternating current. Its components, including the power module, are originally developed by Nissan.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;DC/DC converter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Since electric components such as the audio system, headlights and the navigation system are operated at 12V voltage, the lithium-ion battery&amp;#39;s voltage of 360V for driving is reduced through a DC/DC converter for charging a 12V battery.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Special EV platform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A spacious interior environment is provided by the new, specially designed EV platform and compact lithium-ion battery. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s cargo space capacity is 330L, which provides room for carrying two 9-inch golf bags without folding rear seats.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;span class="small02"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* Capacity under the waist level (calculation based on the VDA method)&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A flat, smooth floor configuration, unlike a gasoline vehicle, contributes to reduced air resistance.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Vehicle body rigidity is improved through adopting a double frame structure and front joint configuration, helping provide stable ride comfort and direct, responsive handling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Unique EV design, advanced features&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Along with its special EV platform and advanced drivetrain technology, Nissan LEAF offers uniquely designed EV exterior styling and an interior with advanced EV features and equipment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Exterior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Created around the principle of &amp;quot;smart fluidity,&amp;quot; Nissan LEAF offers smart styling with the ultimate level of flowing lines and aerodynamics.&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Replacing a gasoline engine with a compact motor allows the use of a simple front-end design without a radiator grille. Its flowing lines are linked to a large roof spoiler expressing dynamic movement in the rear.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The large vertically oriented LED headlights feature a sophisticated original design that is unique to the Nissan EV. The headlights protrude from the body and are positioned in a deep V-shape to help control airflow to the side mirrors and reduce drag and wind noise - a critical design consideration since wind noise is more noticeable in EVs with their quiet motor operation.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A cross section of the roof antenna has a newly adopted shape, which helps reduce wind noise.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Excellent aerodynamics performance is realized through the use of thin, high-intensity LED rear combination lamps and a large diffuser with an aero fin mounted below the rear bumper - which features pronounced corners and no tailpipe.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A solar cell module is adopted to provide an auxiliary charge for the 12V battery used for the navigation system and other equipment. (Standard on G grade)&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF is available in a choice of five exterior colors, including Aqua Blue (three-coat pearl metallic) - a new color inspired by the view of Earth as seen from space.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				An EV Iconic Blue is used as an accent color to evoke the image of Nissan LEAF in various components, including the headlight inner units and the emblem.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Interior&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s simple and elegant interior creates a light, clean and open EV image.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The simple yet elegant interior space is equipped with features that provide great visibility, operability and a comfortable feel to the touch, helping provide outstanding comfort. The interior is offered in a light, refreshing color, Airy Grey.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				The door trim combines synthetic leather and suede materials where it touches the body, providing a comfortable and soft feeling, while plated inside door handles express a luxury feel. The seat cloth is made of recycled plastic bottles and provides a suede-like texture and comfortable feel to the touch.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A flat-panel center cluster, designed like an advanced, smart digital device, has switches of the same shape, creating a sense of unity. With functions concentrated in the one area, user-friendly operation is realized.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				As with the Nissan LEAF exterior, an EV Iconic Blue is used as an interior accent color to intensify the image of EV in various parts, including a CI badge on the steering wheel.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		Equipment&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Twin Digital Meter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Nissan LEAF adopts an elegant twin digital meter layout, with a two-tier display focused on functionality and user-friendliness. An Eco Indicator, which gives the driver instant fuel economy readouts, and the speedometer are shown on the easier-to-read upper meter. ECO TREE&lt;span class="sup01"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt; shows cumulative results of eco driving. On the lower meter, a Power Meter displaying power output and regeneration of the lithium-ion battery and a Multi Information Display, which imparts charging and electricity efficiency information, battery remaining capacity, driving range and various warnings, are shown.&lt;br /&gt;
				&lt;span class="small02"&gt;&lt;font size="2"&gt;* ECO TREE is a trademark of Hino Motors, Ltd.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Electric Shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A new mouse-type electric shift can easily be operated just with a flick of the wrist by wrapping the palm around it. Nissan&amp;#39;s first by-wire system provides a light operational feeling.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Start-up Sound&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When the power switch is on and the vehicle is ready to start, a pleasant tone (rather than a harsh engine sound) tells the driver that the vehicle is ready. The driver can easily switch between a choice of three different sounds. Along with the Twin Digital Meter, hospitality and a sophisticated EV feel is provided.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;&amp;quot;Approaching Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians&amp;quot; System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				When driving at a low speed, the &amp;quot;Approaching Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians&amp;quot; system emits a sound to alert pedestrians that a vehicle is approaching.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;Charging Method and Equipments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Charging ports are located in the front hood for &amp;quot;normal charge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;quick charge.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				It takes about 8 hours after the charge warning light is on to fully charge the battery for 200V normal charge. The battery can be charged up to 80% in about 30 minutes by quick charge.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A 7.5-meter charging cable for 200V normal charge is fitted as standard.&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				Safe charging is ensured by making a charging cable and charging ports waterproof and by installing drainage ports in the charging connecter and the charging ports. In case water enters and causes a short circuit, a control box that cuts electricity is installed in the charging cable.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Information function to be always &amp;quot;connected&amp;quot; to EV&lt;br /&gt;
		&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="text-under01"&gt;EV-IT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
		&lt;ul&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;
				A global common ICT (Information and Communication Technology) system designed specifically for EV is adopted for application with Nissan LEAF. It not only provides on-board always-connected driving support on the car&amp;#39;s navigation display, but also supports EV driving even before the driver gets in the car and after getting out by accessing a dedicated Website for EV owners via mobile phones (including smart phones) or computers. This ICT system offers features unique to EV, including driving history and battery condition management, remote control for battery charging and climate control, and energy management for the coming renewable energy era. The NISSAN CARWINGS Data Center, an information control center, communicates with the car&amp;#39;s navigation system via the onboard Telematics Communication Unit (TCU). With the ICT system, Nissan LEAF owners are connected at all times to the data and information they need to optimize their EV experience.&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p class="indentBot00"&gt;

            <title>Grupo Bimbo begins construction on world's largest wind farm for food industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On December 2, Daniel Servitje, chief executive officer of Grupo Bimbo, accompanied by the Secretary of Energy, Dr. Georgina Kessel, senior managers of the Comision Federal de Electricidad (Federal Commission for Electric Power), and the Energy Regulation Commission and with the presence of Officials from the Government of the State of Oaxaca, announced the start of construction work at the Piedra Larga wind farm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When completed, it will generate almost 100 percent of the electrical power consumed by Grupo Bimbo in Mexico. With an installed power of 90 megawatts, the farm will be able to supply the electric power consumed by 65 of the company&amp;#39;s facilities (production plants and other operation centers). Grupo Bimbo has also invited Grupo Calidra, Frialsa Frigorificos and Papalote Museo del Nino to participate in the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The wind farm will be located in Union Hidalgo, State of Oaxaca. It was made possible thanks to the strategic alliance fostered by the Government of Mexico, the private sector and banks. The operation of the wind farm will be possible through the partnership of Grupo Bimbo with DEMEX (Mexican Wind Farm Developments), an affiliate of the Spanish company Renovalia Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Grupo Bimbo has focused its attention on the implementation of wind energy to comply with the group&amp;#39;s permanent commitment to the environment and to the well-being of future generations. &amp;quot;The construction of this wind farm is the cornerstone in our effort to continue growing with nature&amp;#39;s force; making us the first company in the food industry to make this great change to use renewable energy sources,&amp;quot; said Servitje. &amp;quot;It represents an unprecedented effort in the use of renewable, clean and virtually endless energy: The green energy,&amp;quot; Servitje added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The chairman of Renovalia Energy, Juan Domingo Ortega Martinez, said, &amp;quot;This construction constitutes a landmark in the expansion policy of renewable energies in Mexico. The total investment for wind project is approximately US$ 200 million. This wind farm will begin commercial operations for Grupo Bimbo at the end of 2011.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dr. Georgina Kessel said, &amp;quot;There is no question that these types of actions contribute to reaching the goal of substituting clean energies. The challenge in Mexico is to make better use of this type of energy to strengthen the country&amp;#39;s power safety, and consolidating at the same time, active work to face climate change.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to Dr. Kessel, &amp;quot;These actions will allow the country to obtain a total of 35 percent of power generation with clean energies by 2024.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grupo Bimbo is constantly trying to reduce its environmental footprint, that is why it operates under the highest performance standards,&amp;quot; said Servitje. &amp;quot;This is an effort we have been carrying out for 10 years and is gaining more importance within our five axes of environmental sustainability: energy savings, water savings, emissions reduction, waste management and social entrepreneurial responsibility.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Grupo Bimbo has had a role in the GEI Mexico Program since 2005. This year, for the fifth consecutive year, Grupo Bimbo has been acknowledged by SEMARNAT for declaring and publishing the GEI inventory of all its facilities and vehicles in Mexico and for the effort it has made to decrease its emissions,&amp;quot; said Luis Rene Martinez Souverville, Grupo Bimbo corporate affairs director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/8xoPAkjWZGY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Swagelok appoints director of sustainability</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Swagelok Company announced the appointment of Edward Bayer to director of sustainability. In this newly created position, Bayer will focus on the strategic use of energy within the company, including reducing Swagelok&amp;rsquo;s worldwide energy consumption and evaluating alternative energy sources. He will also support the company&amp;rsquo;s current conservation and recycling programs as part of its commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Conservation and awareness of our impact on our environment &amp;ndash; for the sake of our customers, associates, and the communities we live in &amp;ndash; has always been at the heart of Swagelok&amp;rsquo;s operations,&amp;rdquo; said Arthur F. Anton, president and CEO, Swagelok Company. &amp;ldquo;Our core values demand no less, and we believe that formalizing the sustainability leadership role only strengthens our current programs and positions us for future growth.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bayer brings a variety of business and leadership experiences to this new role at Swagelok. He has held several leadership roles during his 25-plus-year tenure with the company, most recently as the director of facility construction projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>GE demonstrates 'electric bus of the future'</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The hybrid systems research team at GE Global Research, the company&amp;rsquo;s central technology development arm, announced a significant breakthrough that could help accelerate the electrification of bus fleets, delivery trucks and other larger, heavy-duty vehicle fleets.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The GE team successfully demonstrated a dual battery system on a zero tailpipe emissions hybrid transit bus that pairs a high-energy density sodium battery with a high-power lithium battery. To view a video of the bus being test driven, &lt;a _extended="true" class="bhv_external" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwQpLKTngTQ"&gt;-click here-&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While significant advances in battery technology have been made, further reductions in the size and cost of batteries will be needed to enable the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. GE researchers believe a dual system with high power and energy storage capacity could achieve the optimal electric driving range and acceleration requirements at a more practical size scale and cost for larger vehicles.&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The research is being done as part of a $13 million research project GE is engaged in with the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) and Northeast Advanced Vehicle Consortium, funded un&lt;span&gt;der the National Fuel Cell Bus Program&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Public transit and delivery service providers recognize the importance and benefits of transitioning to an electric fleet, but are looking for cost-effective solutions to make that possible,&amp;rdquo; said &lt;a _extended="true" class="bhv_external" href="http://ge.geglobalresearch.com/blog/an-ev-battery-just-the-right-size-and-cost-for-buses/"&gt;Lembit Salasoo&lt;/a&gt;, senior electrical engineer and principal investigator on the hybrid bus project at GE Global Research.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;ldquo;With the cost of the battery remaining a principal hurdle, a dual battery system could bring these costs down and help accelerate the electric revolution for bus and delivery truck fleets representing hundreds of thousands of vehicles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re entering a decade of unprecedented activity and developments in electrified transportation,&amp;rdquo; Salasoo added. &amp;ldquo;With heavier vehicle platforms, both energy storage and power are a premium to deliver optimal vehicle performance, but the exact needs can vary based on a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s size and drive cycle. The beauty of our dual battery system is that it can be scaled to deliver just the right combination of power and storage.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the 843,000 buses registered in the U.S. (including most of the 63,000 transit buses and 480,000 school buses) travel less than 100 miles per day.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Enabling more of these buses to transition to an all-electric, zero emissions platform would dramatically reduce CO2 emissions and petroleum fuel consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most types of batteries today come with a trade-off between power and energy storage.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;For example, lithium batteries, provide a lot of power for acceleration, but are not optimized to store energy for driving range.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Sodium batteries are on the opposite side of the spectrum. They store large amounts of energy, but are less optimized for power. GE&amp;rsquo;s dual battery combines the best attributes of both chemistries into a single system. In the hybrid transit bus demonstration, the lithium battery focused on the high power acceleration and braking, while the sodium battery provided an even electric power flow to extend the bus range.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;Each type of battery does what it does best.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span&gt;In addition to optimizing performance, a dual system can reduce the cost of a battery by up to 20% compared to a single battery system for vehicle applications like transit buses and delivery trucks that require significant power and energy storage capacity. The key cost advantage of a dual system is that it provides flexibility to integrate less expensive battery chemistries without having to increase the size of the battery to address a vehicle&amp;rsquo;s power and energy storage needs.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;A&lt;/span&gt; single battery system would require a more costly scale up in the size of the battery to achieve the same result. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align: justify"&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;The development of a dual battery system and partnership with the FTA is a key part of GE&amp;rsquo;s growing hybrid and electric technology portfolio. GE is actively exploring partnership opportunities across the electric vehicle value chain through its Licensing business to commercialize its dual battery technology.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;GE also is developing new technologies and products to support the integration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and electric vehicles (EV) into the electric grid. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re building a new battery factory in Schenectady, N.Y., which will commercialize GE&amp;rsquo;s new Durathon battery with best-in-class sodium technology performance.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;In July, GE announced the launch of WattStation, a new electric vehicle charging station that will be commercially available globally in 2011. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;In April, GE signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the automaker, Nissan to explore new technologies that will be needed to build a reliable, dynamic smart-charging infrastructure.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;In September, GE established a technology and financing partnership with Better Place to accelerate the global deployment of an electrical vehicle infrastructure through collaboration in four key areas: standards-based technology development, battery financing, joint fleet electrification programs and consumer awareness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;Building on these investments and research activities, GE announced it would purchase 25,000 electric vehicles by 2015 for its own fleet and through its Capital Fleet Services business - the largest-ever single electric vehicle commitment.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;GE will initially purchase 12,000 GM vehicles, beginning with the Chevrolet Volt in 2011, and will add other vehicles as manufacturers expand their electric vehicle portfolios.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;GE&amp;rsquo;s activities in hybrid and battery technologies, electric vehicle charging and PHEV and EV grid integration are closely aligned with its ecomagination initiative. Ecomagination represents the company&amp;rsquo;s commitment to deliver new clean products and technologies to market that help solve our toughest environmental challenges.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;G&lt;/span&gt;E has more than 80 eco-certified products, including cutting-edge energy efficient lighting and appliance products, which have met the Initiative&amp;rsquo;s goal of improving both operational and environmental performance.&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Recently, the company pledged to double its investment in clean R&amp;amp;D over the next five years from $5 billion to $10 billion. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;About GE&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Systems Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span style="font-family: ge inspira"&gt;GE&amp;rsquo;s Hybrid Systems Team is a diverse group of some 25 scientists and engineers &amp;ndash; a few with more than three decades of experience in electric and hybrid vehicle technologies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/lPplZW8_tCk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Massachusetts manufacturer to pay fine to settle clean water violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A company in Billerica, Mass., that makes X-ray detection and related equipment has agreed to pay $40,000 to settle Environmental Protection Agency claims that it violated the federal Clean Water Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England office, American Science &amp;amp; Engineering violated the Clean Water Act by discharging without authorization stormwater associated with industrial activity. The stormwater was discharged into wetlands adjacent to a Shawsheen River tributary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Clean Water Act requires many industrial operations to have permits and controls in place to prevent pollutants from being discharged with stormwater into nearby waterways. Each site must have a stormwater pollution prevention plan that puts in place practices that the company will follow to prevent runoff from being contaminated by pollutants. Without these controls, stormwater can pick up pollutants as it flows over the site. The stormwater can then carry the pollutants to nearby waterways, where they can degrade water quality as well as swimming, fishing and drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	AS&amp;amp;E disclosed its violations to EPA and took some measures to minimize storm water runoff, but the company did not meet all legal requirements, nor all the requirements of EPA&amp;rsquo;s self-disclosure policy. EPA took the company&amp;rsquo;s disclosure into consideration in setting the penalty.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Dow secures renewable biomass energy source at Brazilian facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Dow Chemical Company on December 1 announced that its largest manufacturing facility in Brazil, the Aratu Complex, will add biomass to its portfolio of clean energy sources by the end of 2012. Upon project completion in December 2012, Aratu will be more than 75 percent sourced for power and steam through hydropower and eucalyptus cogeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Eucalyptus wood biomass will be used to produce steam for the site&amp;rsquo;s chlor-alkali and chlorohydrin production processes. Dow has signed a supply agreement with Energias Renov&amp;aacute;veis do Brasil (ERB), which will invest, install and operate the biomass co-generation plant. The plant is expected to reduce the site&amp;rsquo;s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 180,000 metric tons annually, and conserve 200,000 m3 of natural gas daily. The agreement will also enable carbon credits for Dow through the CO2 emission savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Dow, we&amp;rsquo;re focused on energy solutions that will unlock dramatic improvements in our energy profile as well as that of our customers and partners,&amp;rdquo; said Andrew Liveris, chairman and chief executive officer of Dow. &amp;ldquo;Our commitment to a sustainable energy future, like the Aratu project, will continue to drive unparalleled economic and societal benefits.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Aratu site currently receives all of its electricity from hydropower, and will be the first petrochemical user of biomass in Brazil through the supply agreement. The steam produced by the co-generation plant will be integral to the manufacture of materials for the automotive, building and industrial sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The new agreement at Aratu represents a significant milestone in our strategy to implement clean energy technology in our operations and advance our leadership in energy efficiency and carbon management,&amp;rdquo; said Doug May, vice president of energy and climate change at Dow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From 1994 to 2009, Dow has conserved over 1,700 trillion Btu of energy from its operations, which is the equivalent to the electrical energy used by all residential buildings in California for a full year. Dow&amp;rsquo;s energy efficiency efforts have also prevented more than 90 million metric tons of CO2 from entering the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About The Dow Chemical Company &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Dow connects chemistry and innovation with the principles of sustainability to help address many of the world&amp;rsquo;s most challenging problems such as the need for clean water, renewable energy generation and conservation, and increasing agricultural productivity. Dow&amp;rsquo;s diversified industry-leading portfolio of specialty chemical, advanced materials, agrosciences and plastics businesses delivers a broad range of technology-based products and solutions to customers in approximately 160&amp;nbsp;countries and in high growth sectors such as electronics, water, energy, coatings and agriculture. In 2009, Dow had annual sales of $45&amp;nbsp;billion and employed approximately 52,000&amp;nbsp;people worldwide. The company&amp;rsquo;s more than 5,000&amp;nbsp;products are manufactured at 214&amp;nbsp;sites in 37&amp;nbsp;countries across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/pwpN2U4YQbA" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Voluntary standard covers chemical protective clothing</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img align="left" border="0" hspace="7" src="http://www.ansi.org/news_publications/images/News_Images/2728/chemical.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hazardous chemicals are used in many industries, from agriculture to manufacturing to pharmaceuticals. Whether solid, liquid or gas, they pose some of the most serious health hazards facing workers today. The &lt;a href="http://www.safetyequipment.org/" target="_blank"&gt;International Safety Equipment Association&lt;/a&gt; (ISEA), a ANSI member and accredited standards developer, recently released an American National Standard (ANS) that addresses protective apparel for workers who come into contact with these chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ANSI%2fISEA+103-2010" target="_blank"&gt;ANSI/ISEA 103-2010&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Classification and Performance Requirements for Chemical Protective Clothing&lt;/i&gt;, establishes performance, labeling, and certification requirements for clothing designed to protect against hazardous chemicals. The standard establishes six categories of protective apparel, along with a guide to aid users in selecting the appropriate garment based on the specific hazards present in the working environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The standard also outlines performance test methods for material and whole garments in each category, guidelines for conducting hazard and risk assessments, and recommended performance levels. Items covered include encapsulating suits, splash suits, coveralls, jackets, pants, aprons, smocks, hoods, sleeves, and shoe and boot covers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/wdKyNMu98vw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>New EPA tool to promote safer chemicals and products</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As part of Administrator Lisa P. Jackson&amp;rsquo;s commitment to strengthen and reform chemical management, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on November 30 announced new criteria to help companies and other groups, such as states and environmental organizations, identify safer chemicals. As part of the agency&amp;rsquo;s Design for the Environment (DfE) program, EPA unveiled the new criteria which are an important tool under its DfE Alternatives Assessments for identifying safer alternatives to chemicals that pose a concern to human health and the environment.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This new approach for evaluating and identifying safer chemicals is an important step toward ensuring that that the chemicals used in this country are safe,&amp;rdquo; said Steve Owens, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention. &amp;ldquo;Making this information available will not only lead to the manufacture of safer products, it will increase the public&amp;rsquo;s access to critical chemical information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The DfE program works in partnership with industry, environmental groups, and academia to help industry choose safer alternatives to chemicals that may pose a concern to human health or the environment. Information on chemical hazards from DfE Alternatives Assessments is combined with industry data on performance and cost to guide the choice of safer alternatives. To distinguish among alternatives, DfE evaluates data for each chemical and assigns hazard levels of high, moderate, or low for human health and environmental concerns.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	DfE Alternatives Assessments will be conducted for bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates (NP and NPEs). Both the BPA and decaBDE efforts are under way and include the use of BPA and its alternatives in thermal paper, such as cash register receipts, and the review of flame retardant alternatives to decaBDE in products such as textiles, plastic palettes, and electronics. Assessments of phthalates, the flame retardant HBCD, and NPEs will begin in 2011.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The assessments will lead to the manufacture of safer products and reduced chemical exposures. For example, replacing BPA in thermal paper with safer alternatives will safeguard children, cashiers, and others from BPA in cash register or sales receipts. Similarly, safer alternatives to decaBDE flame retardants used in textiles and electronics will eliminate an important route of human and environmental exposure to this chemical.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA will accept comment on the criteria through January 31, 2011.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Richard Childress Racing shop takes green to the next level</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In the first program of its kind, designed to prevent the unnecessary disposal of aerosol spray cans still containing chemical solutions that can eventually leak into the environment, Safety-Kleen and Richard Childress Racing are teaming up to make sure those cans are empty and recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve been helping keep NASCAR events and teams &amp;#39;green&amp;#39; for years by properly managing a wide range of recyclable fluids used in their shops and cars,&amp;quot; said Eric Zimmer, executive vice president of branch sales and service for Safety-Kleen. &amp;quot;Now we&amp;#39;re taking that to the next level by focusing in on some of the less obvious potential sources of environmental contamination &amp;ndash; such as spray cans &amp;ndash; and we&amp;#39;re proud to be undertaking this industry-leading effort with Richard Childress Racing.&amp;quot; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many businesses simply throw used aerosol cans in the trash, which is perfectly legal, without even thinking about the fact that those cans are not completely empty and that the contents will eventually find their way into the environment. The better option is to make sure the cans are completely empty and then have them recycled, but that has not been easy to do. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now, using a new drain system developed by Safety-Kleen partner Justrite Manufacturing, businesses can easily get all of the material out of an aerosol can, simultaneously preparing the can for recycling and collecting the liquids for recycling or proper disposal. The Childress Racing teams will now be pioneering the use of these machines in their shops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We chose to start with the Childress team because we have been recycling their oil and solvents for years,&amp;quot; Zimmer said. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Richard and his team lead the way on the track and off, so it makes perfect sense that they are the first team to address this issue.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re committed to protecting the environment, and Safety-Kleen handles everything for us that needs specialized management,&amp;quot; said Bill Patterson, vice president for Richard Childress Racing. &amp;quot;They take care of all of the hard stuff &amp;ndash; the things no one wants getting into the environment, like oil, paint, solvents and unused fuel. &amp;nbsp;With Safety-Kleen, we know these materials will be properly managed.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Buddy Judy, manager of Safety-Kleen Motorsports, noted that while aerosol can disposal in landfills is currently allowed, they may soon become a regulated item and Safety-Kleen is trying to help businesses and industries get ahead of the regulatory curve by providing a viable, protective solution today. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;In the racing business, teams follow the good practices of other teams,&amp;quot; said Richard Childress. &amp;quot;Safety-Kleen has tested this new system at the track, and we know it will work just as well in our shops, so we&amp;#39;re taking the lead - something we like to do in all aspects of racing &amp;ndash; and we&amp;#39;re driving our industry in the right direction &amp;ndash; a green direction.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Safety-Kleen &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Safety-Kleen is a leading North American used oil recycling and re-refining, parts cleaning and environmental solutions company, with approximately 4,100 employees serving approximately 330,000 customer locations in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Safety-Kleen provides a broad set of environmentally responsible products and services that keep North American businesses in balance with the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Richard Childress Racing &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Richard Childress Racing has earned more than 180 victories and 12 NASCAR championships, including six in the Sprint Cup Series with the legendary Dale Earnhardt. RCR was the first organization to win championships in the Sprint Cup Series, Nationwide Series and Camping World Truck Series. Its 2010 Sprint Cup Series lineup includes Kevin Harvick (No. 29 Shell-Pennzoil Chevrolet), Jeff Burton (No. 31 Caterpillar Chevrolet) and Clint Bowyer (No. 33 Cheerios/Hamburger Helper Chevrolet). Bowyer drives the No. 21 Zaxby&amp;#39;s Chevrolet in the 2010 Nationwide Series, Austin Dillon drives the No. 3 Bass Pro Shops Chevrolet in the 2010 Camping World Truck Series and Tim George Jr. drives the No 31 RCR Development Chevrolet in the 2010 ARCA Racing Series presented by RE/MAX and Menards. Ty Dillon and Ryan Gifford are RCR developmental drivers in both asphalt and dirt track racing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/6LSnye4w9Cs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GM to add 1,000 electric vehicle engineering and development jobs in Michigan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning November 30, General Motors will add 1,000 engineers and researchers in Michigan over the next two years to significantly expand its vehicle electrification expertise and lead in the development of electric vehicles from hybrids to electric vehicles with extended-range capability, like the Chevrolet Volt. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The commitment by GM CEO Dan Akerson coincides with preparations for delivery of the first Chevrolet Volt electric vehicles with extended-range capability to customers in key states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new jobs will build on GM&amp;#39;s strategy to develop, validate and manufacture automotive battery, electric motor and power control technologies in-house as core competencies. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;GM is going to lead the industry in the adoption of various vehicle electrification technologies, whether its electric vehicles with extended-range capability, like the Chevrolet Volt, or the recently introduced eAssist technology that will debut on the 2012 Buick LaCrosse,&amp;quot; Akerson said. &amp;quot;We want to give our customers energy choices other than petroleum and to make the automobile part of the solution when it comes to the environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deep experience and expertise in batteries, electric motors and power controls will ensure GM provides the best possible electric vehicle choices to customers around the world, Akerson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2007 reveal of the Chevrolet Volt has spurred a flurry of activity in the electrification of the automobile and has become an economic multiplier for the state of Michigan. GM&amp;#39;s electric vehicle engineering investment expands on the more than $700 million GM has invested in eight facilities in Michigan to support Volt production. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM has the industry&amp;#39;s largest and most technologically advanced battery systems lab at its Warren, Mich. Technical Center and has invested $336 million at its Detroit-Hamtramck assembly plant, home of the Volt, along with another $43 million at the industry&amp;#39;s only battery pack manufacturing plant in Brownstown Township, Mich. &amp;nbsp;An additional $162 million investment was announced last week to support powertrain operations in Flint and Bay City, Mich., and Defiance, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to GM&amp;#39;s investments, suppliers such as LG Chem, utility companies such as DTE Energy and organizations including the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, are investing in Michigan jobs to support Chevy Volt and electric vehicle development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The state of Michigan is proud to continue our long partnership with GM as it drives toward a leaner, greener future,&amp;quot; Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm said. &amp;quot;As we work to diversify our state&amp;#39;s economy both within the auto industry and outside of it, electric vehicles will play a major role in re-establishing Michigan as the North American center of automotive manufacturing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/EFYyqpGnmEg" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Survey: Only 7% of shoppers likely to consider electric car for next vehicle purchase</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kelley Blue Book, &lt;a href="http://www.kbb.com/?scid=3099"&gt;www.kbb.com&lt;/a&gt;, the leading provider of new car and used car information, on November 30 reports the results of a recent Kelley Blue Book Market Intelligence study gauging consumer attitudes on electric vehicles. The latest results show that only 7 percent of car shoppers say they are likely to consider an electric vehicle for their next new-vehicle purchase or lease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For the majority of survey respondents, the primary concerns about electric vehicles included the drivable range on a single charge (87 percent) and availability of charging stations (84 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most car shoppers (78 percent) said that if they were to purchase an electric vehicle, it would primarily be used as an everyday or commuter vehicle. In addition, on average, respondents said they would expect an electric vehicle to get 340 miles per charge in order for it to meet their needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Concerning value, nearly all car shoppers (91 percent) feel that electric vehicles are expensive, and 43 percent expect that electric vehicles will not retain their value as well as conventional gas cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Less than half of respondents (45 percent) said they are interested in electric vehicle technology. For those interested in electric vehicle technology, the primary reason cited was reduction in reliance on foreign oil (85 percent), reduction in pollution (83 percent) and reduction in vehicle emissions (83 percent). Only 37 percent said they were interested in electric vehicle technology due to potential tax credits, and a mere 8 percent said they were interested because of potential access to carpool lane stickers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of those interested in electric vehicle technology, the majority (65 percent) said they were open to purchasing an electric vehicle from a company that has not previously sold vehicles in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In gauging awareness of particular electric vehicle models, shoppers identified that they were most aware of the Chevrolet Volt at 71 percent, followed by the Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid at 68 percent. The Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid came in third for awareness at 46 percent, while the Nissan LEAF came in fourth at 45 percent. The Tesla Roadster came in fifth, with 39 percent awareness among consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When shown pictures of electric vehicles that are currently or soon-to-be available for purchase/lease in the United States, the highest percentage of respondents (44 percent) said they would consider purchasing or definitely purchase the Chevrolet Volt, with the Toyota Prius Plug-In Hybrid coming in close second (43 percent), the Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid placing third (42 percent), the Ford Focus Electric reported in fourth (39 percent), and the Nissan LEAF finishing in fifth (34 percent).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	However, according to recent new-car shopper activity on kbb.com, the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan LEAF are trending quite similarly. Since hitting kbb.com in August 2010, both vehicles have had triple digit month-over-month activity increases, with the Volt increasing 138 percent and the LEAF increasing 191 percent for September 2010. The latest activity levels for October 2010 indicate the Volt has a 178 percent month-over-month increase in new-car shopper activity on kbb.com, while the LEAF has a 167 percent month-over-month increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;While it seems the car-shopping public still has a long way to go concerning electric vehicle consideration and understanding the realities of electric vehicle technology, the fact that there are all-new methods of propulsion becoming available to drivers is another great step forward for the automotive industry,&amp;quot; said James Bell, executive market analyst for Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com. &amp;quot;The Volt versus LEAF race continues to heat up, and there are many other players coming to market in the alternative energy space in the near future. Time will tell whether this technology will be readily adopted by a large number of mainstream car buyers, or if this will just be another flash in the pan of vehicle history.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This Kelley Blue Book Market Intelligence study gauging consumer attitudes on electric vehicles was fielded to 219 in-market car shoppers on Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com from October 10-25, 2010. Cited new-car shopper activity was based on month-over-month page view changes for the Chevrolet Volt and Nissan LEAF on Kelley Blue Book&amp;#39;s kbb.com. Month-over-month changes were compared for August vs. September and September vs. October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/uTpXh9zoA9U" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Nissan LEAF named 2011 European Car of the Year</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	In a historic moment for Nissan Motor Company Ltd. and zero-emission vehicles, the 100 percent electric Nissan LEAF was awarded 2011 European Car of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The world&amp;#39;s first mass-marketed, affordable, zero-emission vehicle for the global market beat 40 contenders to win motoring&amp;#39;s most important accolade. This is the first time in the 47-year history of the annual competition that the award has gone to an electric vehicle. Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s rivals included vehicles from brands such as Alfa Romeo, Citroen, Dacia, Ford, Opel/Vauxhall and Volvo. The jury included 57 leading motoring journalists from 23 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;The jury acknowledged today that the Nissan LEAF is a breakthrough for electric cars. Nissan LEAF is the first EV that can match conventional cars in many respects,&amp;quot; said Hakan Matson, president of the jury, Car of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company president and CEO Carlos Ghosn said: &amp;quot;This award recognizes the pioneering zero-emission Nissan LEAF as competitive to conventional cars in terms of safety, performance, spaciousness and handling. It also reflects Nissan&amp;#39;s standing as an innovative and exciting brand with a clear vision of the future of transportation, which we call sustainable mobility. With three other electric vehicles in the pipeline from Nissan - and with the imminent market introduction of four additional electric vehicles from our Alliance partner Renault - Nissan LEAF represents a significant first step toward a zero-emission future.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF is powered by a compact electric motor in the front of the car, which drives the front wheels. The AC motor develops 80 kilowatts of power and 280 Nm of torque, enough for a maximum speed of 145 kilometers per hour (90 mph). The electric motor is powered by a Nissan-developed laminated lithium-ion battery with an output of more than 90 kW. The car has a range of 175 km (New European Driving Cycle) between charges making it a practical proposition for many urban drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vehicle is fully equipped with features such as regenerating braking, air conditioning, satellite navigation, parking camera and advanced on-board IT and telematics systems. Innovative connectivity will allow an owner to set charging functions to monitor the car&amp;#39;s current state of charge and the remaining battery capacity, as well as to heat or cool the interior of the car remotely via mobile phone or computer. The Nissan LEAF will be available in five colors in Europe - blue metallic and pearl, white pearl, silver metallic, black solid and red pearl. The single option is a solar panel mounted in the rear spoiler that supports charging of the car&amp;#39;s 12-volt battery used for powering accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Deliveries in Japan and the United States begin this December. In Europe, deliveries start in early 2011 to Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The zero-emission car is currently being built in Japan, but will also be produced in North America and Europe when new manufacturing facilities open in late 2012 and early 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan&amp;#39;s innovative thinking extends beyond zero-emission mobility. Under the PURE DRIVE label, Nissan manufactures an extended line-up of environmentally friendly, internal combustion engine vehicles offering class-leading fuel efficiency supported by advanced green technologies. In Europe, the company will soon launch an advanced petrol-electric hybrid luxury sedan wearing the Infiniti badge, while hugely popular crossover vehicles, such as Nissan Qashqai and Nissan Juke, have created new and exciting vehicle segments dominated by Nissan. Next year will also see the arrival of the fourth generation Nissan Micra powered by a supercharged version of an all-new 1.2-litre three cylinder direct injection petrol engine with an Idling Stop system to offer spirited performance and CO2 emissions of just 95 grams per kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan has won the CoTY award in Europe before. In 1993, the U.K.-built Nissan Micra became the first car from a Japanese automaker to win the accolade and started Europe&amp;#39;s love affair with the little car that continues today with the recent launch of the newest Nissan Micra model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/sT77_dOP0OI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Recycled clothing finds new home inside next-generation Ford Focus</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Old clothes turn up in plenty of places &amp;ndash; the hamper, the bottom of a closet, behind the washing machine. They&amp;rsquo;re also found in the next-generation Ford Focus, albeit in different and more useful forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2012 Focus, on sale early next year in North America and Europe, uses these cottons from recycled clothing in areas such as carpet backing and sound-absorption materials for interior quietness. Using environmentally friendly materials, including recycled clothing, is one part of Ford&amp;rsquo;s overall green strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Ford is continually looking for greener alternatives,&amp;rdquo; said Carrie Majeske, product sustainability manager. &amp;ldquo;One of our key goals is to use more recycled or renewable materials without compromising performance or durability. Recycled content is a way to divert waste from landfills and reduce the impact of mining virgin material.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;reduce, reuse and recycle&amp;rdquo; commitment is part of the company&amp;rsquo;s broader global sustainability strategy to reduce its environmental footprint while at the same time accelerating the development of advanced, fuel-efficient vehicle technologies around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past several years, Ford has concentrated on increasing the use of non-metal recycled and bio-based materials, including soy foam seat cushions, recycled resins for underbody systems, recycled yarns on seat covers and natural-fiber plastic for interior components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creative, eco-friendly solutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Ford vehicles continue to become more eco-friendly through the creative use of renewable and recycled materials. For instance, one of the clothing materials used in the next-generation Focus is post-consumer cotton that comes from recycled blue jeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The good news is these jeans didn&amp;rsquo;t end up in a landfill, nor did we use the water, fertilizer and land to grow virgin cotton,&amp;rdquo; Majeske said. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s an alternative that our customers can appreciate, it&amp;rsquo;s cost effective, and it&amp;rsquo;s better for our planet. These are the kinds of sustainable solutions we are looking for in all our vehicles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The amount of post-consumer cotton from blue jeans used in a vehicle comes out to roughly two pairs of average-sized American jeans, based on pounds of cotton used per yard of denim and the yards of denim used to make a pair of jeans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Great fuel economy is our first priority for reducing the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s impact on the environment,&amp;rdquo; said Majeske. &amp;ldquo;As we deliver that, we also seek to use materials inside a vehicle that reduce the environmental impact as well. The use of recycled clothing is one step, but what else are people discarding that could be used in our vehicles? Ford is determined to find out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new Focus is the result of a global product development program bringing together Ford&amp;rsquo;s best engineers and designers from around the world. The high-tech, fuel-efficient Focus will be manufactured in Ford plants in Asia, Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/ic5WLz_fu_Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <description>&lt;p class="introduction"&gt;
	Red Bull Racing and Sebastian Vettel became double world champions in 2010 winning the Constructors and Drivers championships. Red Bull Racing develops and manufactures its championship winning car using Siemens&amp;rsquo; software for Product Lifecycle Management (PLM). The software forms the highly efficient digital backbone of the manufacturing process and enables new components to be designed at high speed on the computer, sent into production seconds later by a mouse click and then built into the vehicle. This speeds up development and improves lap times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="introduction"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Siemens PLM software plays an important role within the company feeding data from our design engineers to our manufacturing facilities.&amp;nbsp; This contribution should not be underestimated,&amp;rdquo; said Christian Horner, team principal of the Red Bull Racing team. In addition, Siemens is now reducing the energy consumption and CO2 emissions of the team&amp;rsquo;s factory buildings and production systems in Milton Keynes, England &amp;ndash; making Red Bull Racing a pioneer in the racing world.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			There is no industry where products have to be developed and manufactured as fast as they are at Formula One factories. And nowhere else where minimal changes in configuration can affect the entire performance of the car the way they can in Formula One. Victory and defeat are often only fractions of a second apart. During the brief periods between races, around 100 engineers at Red Bull Racing work under tremendous pressure every day, using Siemens&amp;rsquo; software to make the cars driven by Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber just that bit faster. The engineers virtually develop the entire vehicle, constantly design new components, assemble all 4,000 individual parts and put the vehicle through its paces &amp;ndash; all while sitting at the computer. A mouse click is all it takes for the developers to have the new parts milled and moulded immediately &amp;ndash; it is not necessary to enter any data by hand into the machine tools or other IT systems. By using the software Red Bull Racing has significantly reduced physical prototyping and limited material waste. Additionally, designers and manufacturing regained up to 75 percent of their time by eliminating tedious and repetitive portions of the design and manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			To make the vehicle suitable for the various race tracks with their particular characteristics, many configurations are available. The engineers design and simulate the interplay of the parts on the computer to find the ideal combination. All the developers and engineers across the entire production facility can access all the data they need, whether in the factory or on the racetrack, at any time, and always know what was altered on the car.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Siemens is also optimizing Red Bull Racing&amp;rsquo;s factory with products from its Environmental Portfolio. The object is to significantly reduce the plant&amp;rsquo;s energy costs, resource consumption and CO2 emissions and also make the production processes more efficient. &amp;ldquo;An industrial company like Siemens is an ideal partner for optimizing production &amp;ndash; with expertise accumulated from over 160 years of manufacturing, with 300 plants and the largest Environmental Portfolio in the world,&amp;rdquo; said Horner. Siemens is currently inspecting the entire production process, including all the existing machines and work processes. It is also carrying out an energy check on the building technology, heating and air-conditioning systems.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="boilerplateframe"&gt;
	Siemens AG (Berlin and Munich) is a global powerhouse in electronics and electrical engineering, operating in the industry, energy and healthcare sectors. The company is the world&amp;rsquo;s largest provider of environmental technologies, generating some &amp;euro;28 billion &amp;ndash; more than one-third of its total revenue &amp;ndash; from green products and solutions. In fiscal 2010, which ended on September 30, 2010, revenue totaled &amp;euro;76 billion and net income &amp;euro;4.1 billion. At the end of September 2010, Siemens had around 405,000 employees worldwide.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/2a0C-0mEkiM" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>SME unveils green manufacturing outcome assessment, certificate program</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Kermit the Frog once declared &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s not easy being green.&amp;rdquo; But SME and Purdue TAP are making it easier for manufacturing professionals to become green workers &amp;ndash; one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="http://www.sme.org/index.html"&gt;Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME)&lt;/a&gt; has partnered with Purdue University Technical Assistance Program (TAP) on a Green Manufacturing Specialist Certificate Program. Purdue TAP has developed an extensive training program and SME has developed the outcome assessment. Each program component was built to work together or to use independently, creating a highly flexible workforce development solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Manufacturers are seeing the value of applying green practices to their processes. They are discovering that it&amp;rsquo;s not only good for the environment, but practicing sustainability is also good for the bottom line. And, to be successful in reducing waste, manufacturing employees need to be able to view their work through &amp;ldquo;green lenses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;When we hear about green workers in the media, most people think of jobs in alternative energy fields,&amp;rdquo; said Jeannine Kunz, director of marketing and professional development at SME. &amp;ldquo;But the reality is that just about any job can &amp;ndash; and should &amp;ndash; be green. It&amp;rsquo;s about developing skills within the current workforce so they can identify opportunities to implement environmentally friendly solutions on the plant floor.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics recently came out with its official definition of a green job. The first part describes the jobs we already think about as being part of the &amp;ldquo;green economy&amp;rdquo;: Jobs in businesses that produce goods or provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s the second half of the definition that stretches the current view of green jobs: Jobs in which workers&amp;rsquo; duties involve making their establishment&amp;rsquo;s production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SME worked with green subject-matter experts to research and build the Body of Knowledge (BOK) for the Green Manufacturing Specialist. The panel completed a job-task analysis for the green elements in every production worker&amp;rsquo;s job. This resulted in a BOK that reflects the required knowledge and skills for success in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The SME Green Specialist Outcome Assessment can be used by individual practitioners or manufacturing enterprises to measure current knowledge levels and identify areas where training may be needed. Training could be provided by Purdue TAP &amp;ndash; which developed its curriculum based on the BOK &amp;mdash; a Purdue TAP partner or by using online tools such as SME Tooling U or other qualified training programs. Practitioners can then choose to sit for the exam to earn their Green Manufacturing Specialist Certificate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The key is to be sure the training aligns to the industry-accepted Body of Knowledge,&amp;rdquo; said Kunz. &amp;ldquo;That way you&amp;rsquo;re assured the skills and knowledge you acquire are nationally recognized and demanded by manufacturers and are not specific to an individual training program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About SME&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Society of Manufacturing Engineers (SME) is the premier source for manufacturing knowledge, education and networking. Through its many membership programs, events and activities, SME connects manufacturing practitioners to each other, to the latest technology and the most up-to-date processes spanning all manufacturing industries and disciplines, plus the key areas of aerospace and defense, medical device, motor vehicles, including motorsports, oil and gas and alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/sYrmgz2900I" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Heartland Plating ordered to address hazmat issues at metal electroplating facility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Environmental Protection Agency Region 7 has ordered Heartland Plating Company of Bettendorf, Iowa, and its owners to immediately address a series of issues related to the improper storage and management of hazardous wastes at the metal electroplating facility.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Last month, EPA representatives inspected Heartland Plating&amp;rsquo;s operations at 3900 Elm Street in Bettendorf, and documented throughout the facility spilled and abandoned materials for which the company&amp;rsquo;s representatives could not provide complete and accurate hazardous waste determinations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on container labels and information provided by Heartland employees, EPA inspectors were able to determine that the company was storing or treating a number of wastes, including chromium, zinc, cyanide, cobalt, potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A unilateral administrative order issued today in Kansas City, Kan., requires Heartland Plating and its owners, Marion Patigler and the estate of Gerhard Patigler, to take several immediate actions to address violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The order directs the respondents to refrain from removing or relocating materials currently located at the facility until EPA determines the waste is being handled safely; immediately certify compliance with hazardous waste regulations or halt the generation and management of wastes until such certification can be made; identify all solid and hazardous wastes currently being treated, stored or disposed at the facility; and restrict access to areas of the property where solid and hazardous wastes have been stored or disposed, and to areas where hazardous material has been released.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Additionally, the respondents are ordered to formulate a plan for proper management or disposal of all solid and hazardous wastes at the facility in compliance with RCRA regulations, and to conduct an investigation to determine if wastes have migrated off the site. They must also undertake an immediate cleanup of any hazardous releases on the property, as well as a cleanup of the building and any surrounding areas that may be contaminated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/S2b4ot4WYUY" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>U.S. announces $270 million bankruptcy settlement with chemical manufacturer</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Justice Department and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York on November 23 announced that Tronox Incorporated has agreed to resolve its environmental liabilities for $270 million and 88 percent of Tronox&amp;rsquo;s interest in a pending litigation. The bankruptcy settlement will reimburse EPA for past cleanup costs and fund future cleanups at contaminated sites across the country.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Tronox and 14 of its affiliates filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code on January 12, 2009 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the company was potentially responsible for past costs incurred and future response costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA, commonly known as Superfund) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) relating to sites throughout the country, as well as for penalties under CERCLA, RCRA, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Under the terms of the settlement, Tronox will pay $270 million in cash. The majority of the funding will be placed in five environmental response trusts for the cleanup of numerous sites, most of which have been contaminated with hazardous substances or waste. Non-cash assets, such as insurance and financial assurance assets worth at least $50 million, including property located in Henderson, Nev., will also be provided by Tronox to the environmental response trusts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Tronox, a Delaware corporation based in Oklahoma City, Okla., is a multi-national chemical company that makes and sells titanium dioxide and other specialty chemicals used in plastics, paper and inks. The company has customers located in more than 90 countries and operates in North America, Europe, and Australia. Tronox was created through a spin-off from the Kerr-McGee Corporation. Several months after the spin-off was completed, Anardarko Petroleum Corporation purchased Kerr-McGee for $18 billion.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Tronox is currently involved in litigation against Anadarko and Kerr-McGee over allegations that those companies imposed years worth of legacy liabilities, including environmental obligations on Tronox, leaving Tronox insolvent and undercapitalized. The trial is expected to begin in late 2011 or early 2012. Eighty eight percent of any settlement awarded to Tronox, as a result of that litigation, will be used to fund additional cleanup efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Before being considered by the bankruptcy court for approval, the settlement will be lodged with the bankruptcy court for a period of 30 days to provide public notice and to afford members of the public the opportunity to comment on the settlement.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>EPA fines N.M. firm for illegally disposing hazardous waste, improper sampling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) fined Western Refining Southwest Inc. for failing to adequately monitor benzene discharges and illegally disposing hazardous waste. The company is in noncompliance of a Consent Agreement and Final Order (CAFO) filed in August 2009.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is important to everyone that companies are following proper protocols needed to protect the environment and public health,&amp;rdquo; said EPA regional administrator Al Armendariz. &amp;ldquo;When facilities fail to follow the rules, EPA will act quickly to ensure compliance with the law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Western has received two non-compliance letters from the EPA within the past two months. The first letter of non-compliance dated September 24, 2010, was for improper sampling on August 20-22, 2010 and exceeding benzene levels in wastewater on June 24-25 and August 23, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The second letter dated November 1, 2010, related to similar offenses of improper collection of samples on September 3-7 and improper disposal of hazardous waste on September 30, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Western has 30 days to pay levied fines after of receiving notification letters.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Western operates a petroleum refinery in Jamestown, N.M., approximately 17 miles east of Gallup. The refinery had multiple violations stemming from its storage and treatment of hazardous waste containing benzene, a human carcinogen present in petroleum.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In 2009, EPA and the New Mexico Environmental Department (NMED) brought the violations to the attention of Western. Western agreed to pay $734,008, cease all discharges of benzene and close two aeration lagoons that received hazardous waste.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Whirlpool named to Newsweek's second annual Green Rankings list</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whirlpool Corporation has once again been recognized as one of the top 500 U.S. companies in Newsweek&amp;#39;s second annual Green Rankings, which lists the greenest large companies in the U.S. and globally. Whirlpool ranked 116th on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It is a privilege to be named to Newsweek&amp;#39;s Green Rankings list for the second straight year,&amp;quot; said Jeff M. Fettig, chairman and CEO, Whirlpool Corporation. &amp;quot;Our innovation and long-term commitment to the environment make this distinction possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rankings are divided among industries, with Whirlpool being recognized in the Consumer Products category. Out of a possible 100, Whirlpool Corporation&amp;#39;s overall green score for 2010 is 77.41, ranking it 11th in this category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nearly 40 years ago, Whirlpool Corporation established a corporate office for environmental control and, in 2003, the company became the world&amp;#39;s first appliance manufacturer to announce a global greenhouse gas reduction target. Whirlpool Corporation has made a goal that, with common standards and appropriate incentives in place, by 2015 it will make all the electronically controlled appliances it produces &amp;ndash; everywhere in the world &amp;ndash; capable of receiving and responding to signals from smart grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Newsweek Green Rankings 2010 measures the environmental performance of the 500 largest U.S. and 100 largest global companies, in terms of revenue, market cap and number of employees. The list was launched in 2009 as the first objective &amp;#39;green&amp;#39; analysis of the largest U.S. companies. The 2010 list was published in Newsweek&amp;#39;s October 2010 issue and on the web, and is the first to include a global companies category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The rankings are completed with the help of ASAP Media, Newsweek&amp;#39;s editorial partner. Its research partners on the rankings are RiskMetrics Group, TruCost and CorporateRegister.com. Each research partner provides specific scoring data to be weighted for the overall score of each company.

            <title>Programs help Harrison Steel improve energy efficiency</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	When Harrison Steel Casting Company made the decision to advance its energy-efficiency efforts, the company took stock of the resources available to industry and made a strategic decision to partner with both the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;rsquo;s (EPA) Energy Star program and the U.S. Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s (DOE) Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) Save Energy Now LEADER initiative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel joined both of these programs because it allows the company to take advantage of the multitude of resources available from both Energy Star and the Save Energy Now LEADER programs. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s participation in both programs serves as an example that can be followed by other industrial companies interested in making improvements in energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Harrison Steel discovered, the programs differ in their scope and resources to provide complementary resources for industry. Where Energy Star focuses on assisting companies in establishing effective energy management teams and corporate energy management programs, Save Energy Now LEADER offers technical expertise and assistance for successfully implementing efficiency improvements to industrial systems and processes. Industrial companies that are interested in reducing energy consumption and the associated costs should examine the results that Harrison Steel has realized by partnering with both the Save Energy Now and Energy Star programs.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.noria.com/sites/Uploads/2010/11/23/quick/7fde0248-bbd8-45a3-bcf6-cd34938fc7cd_Harrison.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align="center"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Harrison Steel energy manager Jeremy Allyn points to 2006 as the year that Harrison Steel began a clear commitment to energy reduction; that was the year when the company received an energy audit from Jack Staley of Balance Engineering. The audit produced a fairly extensive list of energy conservation measures. Although Harrison Steel did pursue some of the recommendations, the true value of that initial audit was opening the eyes of the company&amp;rsquo;s leaders and plant staff to the potential of realizing cost savings through the implementation of energy-efficiency projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saving Energy to Improve the Bottom Line &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Energy costs at Harrison Steel typically constitute 5 to 8 percent of sales. In 2008, the company was operating at full capacity, and it spent approximately $5 million on electricity and $4 million on natural gas. However, it should be noted that Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s natural gas costs were slightly above average that year due to the higher-than-normal prices at the time. The company&amp;rsquo;s electricity prices in 2008 were 6.8 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh) with approximately 73.5 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of usage that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2008, the average operating profit for steel foundries with more than $25 million in annual sales, such as Harrison Steel, was 6.6 percent of sales. This slim profit margin is typical for steel foundries, and reducing operating costs through energy savings can help increase that margin and provide a competitive edge. Because rising energy costs can negatively affect profits, Harrison Steel understood that every dollar saved on energy spending would go directly to the bottom line. Additionally, the company understood that energy efficiency measures could have a more immediate impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For example, a company with a profit margin similar to Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s that cuts energy spending by $66,000 through efficiency measures like lighting or stopping air leaks would have to increase its total sales by $1 million to achieve the same financial impact. Also, an energy-efficiency project is a constant source of savings that a company can continue to experience year after year, while increasing sales volume on a constant basis is much more difficult. Harrison Steel understands these business-side benefits associated with capturing energy savings, in addition to the benefits that increased energy efficiency has for the environment. In fact, the company has even considered creating a different &amp;ndash; and higher &amp;ndash; internal rate of return (IRR) for energy projects since they include positive externalities and dependable, consistent savings. Nonetheless, even with using the same IRR as for other projects in the company, Harrison Steel has been able to identify and complete projects with high enough savings to justify implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Initiating Energy Projects&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The 2006 energy audit helped Harrison Steel to realize the potential savings that were available by upgrading equipment and improving production processes to increase efficiency. The company began to undertake projects with promising energy cost savings based on the audit recommendations. One such project involved an upgrade to the natural gas burners used for preheating ladles that hold molten metal. The burners were old and obsolete, using a less-than-optimal air and gas mixture and producing a poor flame shape. Harrison Steel chose to implement this project because of its capacity to reduce operating expenses while only costing approximately $17,500 to implement. The estimated energy savings from the improved burners is an impressive $73,857 per year, which means the repayment period for this project was less than three months. To achieve the same annual affect on the bottom line through increased sales, Harrison Steel would have had to generate an additional $1,119,045 in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since that initial implementation, Harrison Steel has continued to make progress, including activities undertaken during the company&amp;rsquo;s 2009 Christmas shutdown. Allyn took advantage of the unusually quiet plant to perform his own assessment to locate air leaks. A single 1/16-inch diameter air leak in a compressed air system at 100 pounds per square inch (psi) loses air at 6.5 cubic feet per minute. At a $.06 per kWh rate, based on 24-hour-a-day operation, such leaks can result in added costs of $633 per year. Equipped with nothing but the naked ear, Allyn was able to locate around 100 air leaks. Harrison Steel uses approximately 5,000 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM) of compressed air &amp;ndash; or 2.6 billion standard cubic feet (SCF) annually &amp;ndash; with the largest end-use being the pneumatic transportation of sand for making molds. Fixing those air leaks identified by Allyn was believed to have produced approximately $15,000 in annual energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Another project identified in the 2006 energy audit that Harrison Steel is currently implementing is a variable speed drives project for its well pumps. This upgrade will allow the company to actually slow down the pumps to control the plant&amp;rsquo;s water pressure rather than using demand valves to throttle the pressure while the machine is running at full speed. This variable speed drives upgrade will cost $25,000 to implement and will save the company approximately $16,800 per year in electricity costs &amp;ndash; a payback period of less than 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In the fall of 2009, Harrison Steel began its partnership with EPA&amp;rsquo;s Energy Star for Industry program, a voluntary government partnership program aimed at helping companies develop and improve energy management programs. Harrison Steel became aware of Energy Star through its work in the Energy Star Focus on Energy Efficiency in the metalcasting industry. The Energy Star program offers guidance to its partners focused on strengthening energy management and establishing corporate energy programs and practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In making the decision to partner with EPA, Harrison Steel was particularly attracted to the idea of associating the company with the popular Energy Star brand, a national symbol of energy efficiency and environmental protection. Harrison Steel saw joining the Energy Star program as a way of building a sustainable energy management framework for its energy efforts, making them more personal to employees, not just a list of engineering items to complete. The program also provided Harrison Steel access to a network of companies undertaking similar efforts. Under the program, a Strategic Energy Advisor (SEA) was assigned to Harrison Steel; that SEA is now working with the company to help it build an Energy Team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, Harrison Steel has experienced two main benefits from partnering with Energy Star. First, the company has been able to interact one-on-one with its SEA in order to learn from the experiences of other companies in establishing an Energy Team. Second, the company has gained valuable insights from Web conferences that offer the opportunity to network with and learn from other professionals involved in energy management at organizations with similar goals and challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to Energy Star&amp;rsquo;s partnership for industry, Harrison Steel also values Energy Star as a resource for improving building envelope systems. Energy Star has resources for energy management in buildings such as office and warehouse facilities. For example, the 2006 energy audit had a recommendation for Harrison Steel to upgrade lighting within certain storage and office buildings. Although Harrison Steel had this report for years, it was unable to implement the recommendation until Energy Star assisted in the formation of the Harrison Steel Energy Team. This team has been able to focus on moving ahead with such projects, and Harrison Steel has now approved a lighting project costing around $10,000 for one of the company&amp;rsquo;s storage facilities. This project will install more efficient lighting in the storage facility, as well as use motion sensor lighting controls, which will compound the cost savings by automatically turning off lights when no one is in certain parts of the building. The lighting upgrade is expected to save the company between $2,500 and $4,500 per year in electricity costs, the equivalent of increasing annual sales by $38,000 to $68,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Partnering with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER Program&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition to partnering with the EPA, Harrison Steel decided in the spring of 2010 to partner with ITP&amp;rsquo;s Save Energy Now LEADER initiative. The company quickly recognized the added value that Save Energy Now offered. Once the company began looking at the Save Energy Now resources online, it realized that ITP offers technical expertise and engineering applied to industrial energy. Harrison Steel appreciated Save Energy Now&amp;rsquo;s technical tools that could be applied to the company&amp;rsquo;s systems. This DOE expertise compliments the work the company had begun with Energy Star. Harrison Steel decided it should also join the Save Energy Now LEADER initiative after recognizing ITP&amp;rsquo;s technical expertise in industrial systems, which are in-depth and detail-specific to industrial processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Harrison Steel immediately benefitted from Save Energy Now through the use of the initiative Web site materials like information on improving energy efficiency through upgrading existing standard belts to newer V-belts for belt-driven equipment, such as fans. Standard belts are approximately 95 percent efficient in transferring mechanical energy, but the V-belts improve efficiency by an additional 2 percent since they require less energy to bend and do not slip. Harrison Steel&amp;rsquo;s energy team also utilized ITP&amp;rsquo;s online materials to gain insight and instruction that may allow the company to implement a new project dealing with combustion efficiency of heat treatment furnaces. This project would focus on controlling the oxygen level, making sure there is not too much air in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example for Other Industrial Companies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The complementary nature of the resources provided by the Energy Star and Save Energy Now initiatives is an important take-away concept for other industrial companies interested in advancing energy management programs. As Allyn noted, where Energy Star for Industry shines in terms of its energy management resources, including energy team support and motivating brand, Save Energy Now brings the engineering tools needed to achieve implementation. Companies partnering with both programs will find themselves equipped with the full spectrum of tools needed to plan and achieve energy savings.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Hasbro sets new environmental sustainability goals</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Hasbro Inc. announced November 22 that it will be taking a wide range of steps in the coming years to build upon its successes in the areas of corporate responsibility and environmental sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Beginning in 2011, the company will eliminate all wire ties from its packaging. In addition, for 2011 the company has set a goal that at least 75 percent of its paper packaging will be derived from recycled material or sources that practice sustainable forest management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By 2015, Hasbro has set a goal of 90 percent usage of these materials and sources for all of its paperboard packaging and in-box game content. Hasbro is also working with its core toy and game licensees to help them put similar standards in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To further support and ensure the success of the company&amp;rsquo;s efforts in sustainability, Hasbro will be hiring a director of product and packaging sustainability, reporting directly into the global chief development officer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Walmart applauds Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s industry leadership position in the area of environmental sustainability, which includes its initiative to systematically reduce, and eventually replace, wire ties with sustainable and innovative materials made from paper rattan and other materials,&amp;rdquo; said Laura Phillips, Walmart&amp;rsquo;s senior vice president of toys and seasonal merchandising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s commitment to sustainability has been, and continues to be a high priority in virtually all facets of our operations,&amp;rdquo; said Brian Goldner, Hasbro&amp;rsquo;s president and CEO. &amp;ldquo;The company&amp;rsquo;s ongoing focus on sustainability is critically important to Hasbro and to the consumers around the world who enjoy our brands and products. Importantly, we will be taking additional steps in the area of sustainability going forward, building upon what we have already accomplished in recent years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The advances in sustainability announced by Hasbro reflect its leadership position and an ongoing corporate responsibility commitment, with a specific focus on making improvements that will promote sustainable sourcing of materials. In 2010, Hasbro significantly reduced plastic bags from its product instructions, removing some 800,000 pounds of material worldwide from the waste stream. Currently, more than 90 percent of solid waste generated at the company&amp;rsquo;s owned and operated manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts and Ireland is recycled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Hasbro Inc. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Hasbro is a branded play company providing children and families around the world with a wide-range of immersive entertainment offerings based on the company&amp;rsquo;s world class brand portfolio. From toys and games, to television programming, motion pictures, video games and a comprehensive licensing program, Hasbro strives to delight its customers through the strategic leveraging of well-known and beloved brands such as TRANSFORMERS, LITTLEST PET SHOP, NERF, PLAYSKOOL, MY LITTLE PONY, G.I.

            <title>With commercialization of electric cars, planes are close behind</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Now that &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/in-largest-single-commitment-ge-to-buy-25000-electric-vehicles/" jquery1290456817274="8"&gt;electric cars have hit the mainstream&lt;/a&gt;, it raises the question, what about other forms of transportation running on electricity? Specifically, will we ever see electric planes flying over the horizon?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Believe it or not, they&amp;rsquo;re already here. The battery-powered &lt;a href="http://yuneeccouk.site.securepod.com/Aircraft.html" jquery1290456817274="9"&gt;Yuneec E430&lt;/a&gt; two-seater is currently in production (you can fly away with one for less than a hundred grand). And the &lt;a href="http://www.lange-aviation.com/htm/english/products/antares_20e/antares_20E.html" jquery1290456817274="10"&gt;Antares 20E sailplane&lt;/a&gt; has electric propulsion that can take it to 10,000 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/electric-flight1.jpg" /&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Ready to go:&lt;/span&gt; The Yuneec E430 above was turning heads at this &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/oshkosh-part-2-flying-smart-grids-a-salute-to-vets/" jquery1290456817274="11"&gt;summer&amp;rsquo;s Oshkosh Air Show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But what about commercial flight? You know, the big Trans-Atlantic planes, with flight attendants and snacks? Not only would electric planes make zero-emission flight a reality, but they could fly much more quietly than conventional jets &amp;mdash; which would be more pleasant for passengers, and could ultimately bring airports closer to city centers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even these are a definite possibility: Pranav Patel, Chief Marketing Officer at GE Aviation Systems, says electric planes the size of 737s could be flying commercial routes by 2040 or 2045.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the electric evolution is already underway for conventional planes. &amp;ldquo;If you look at new jets such as &lt;a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/787family/" jquery1290456817274="12"&gt;Boeing&amp;rsquo;s Dreamliner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.jsf.mil/" jquery1290456817274="13"&gt;Joint Strike Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, large portions of their systems are [already] electrified,&amp;rdquo; Patel says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The next generation of commercial jets will have &amp;ldquo;more dynamic power management, allowing essentially a &amp;lsquo;SmartGrid on Aircraft,&amp;rsquo; with open rotor types of high-efficiency jet engines,&amp;rdquo; according to Patel. The eventual goal is &amp;ldquo;electric propulsion zero-emission aircraft,&amp;rdquo; which will have an &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-and-nasa-to-test-open-rotor-jet-engine-systems/" jquery1290456817274="14"&gt;open-structure propulsion&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; so &amp;ldquo;when the plane becomes all electric, the motor will still have a propeller-type open-fan structure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So just how fast will these electric planes fly? As fast &amp;mdash; or faster &amp;mdash; than today&amp;rsquo;s conventional jets. &amp;ldquo;[Electric planes would be] no different than cars today,&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;Take the electric car and look at the torque and speed it gives you. It&amp;rsquo;s actually more torque than you get with a regular [gas-powered] engine.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, that&amp;rsquo;s not to say that the Chevy Volt is fully comparable to a 747. &amp;ldquo;The biggest difference between electric cars and electric planes is you need a significantly higher energy density storage system [for planes],&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;Weight is very important, because with planes you&amp;rsquo;re talking about the lift, as well as the range.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In pursuit of that high density power, engineers who will soon be located at &lt;a href="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/EPISCENTER_Nov_2010.pdf" jquery1290456817274="15"&gt;Electrical Power Integrated Systems&lt;/a&gt; (EPISCENTER), GE&amp;rsquo;s new electrical-power R&amp;amp;D center in Dayton, Ohio, are working on aircraft systems that will use solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) power, with lithium batteries as intermediate storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Here is &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/new-electric-flight-rd-center-to-bring-jobs-to-ohio/" jquery1290456817274="16"&gt;EPISCENTER&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; road map to electric commercial flight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	1. Shrink the on-board components of the plane to roughly one-third of their current weight and volume, (via advances in high power semiconductor devices ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	2. Migrate flight control systems away from hydraulic and into electro-mechanical, in order to integrate with electric propulsion systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	3. Finalize SOFC fuel cell development. Batteries alone don&amp;rsquo;t have the power density required for long flights &amp;mdash; but will remain an important link in the power chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	4. Optimize high-speed superconducting motors to make the most efficient use of precious on-board power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So will there someday be 747&amp;rsquo;s that run like the Chevy Volt? &amp;ldquo;Sure,&amp;rdquo; says Patel. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s all about energy-optimized aircraft. Some say 50 or 60 years down the road is aggressive, some say maybe not.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And oh by the way, how about helicopters? &amp;ldquo;The short answer is Yes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Auto parts manufacturer expands to solar market</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ontario&amp;#39;s growing clean energy economy is helping auto parts maker Samco Machinery Ltd. expand its business and create up to 60 jobs by adapting its auto parts plant to manufacture solar energy components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Toronto-based Samco is updating its machinery and investing in new equipment to manufacture solar racking equipment in partnership with United States-based SunEdison. Solar racking equipment is used to hold solar energy panels and angle them towards the sun. The Ontario-made equipment will serve the growing demand for solar panels in the province and across North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	By shutting down all dirty coal-fired generation and moving to renewable energy sources like wind, solar and water, Ontario is becoming a world leader in the clean energy industry. Ontario&amp;#39;s clean energy economy is attracting investment, creating jobs and cleaning the air we breathe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In recent months, Ontario has attracted over $1 billion in private sector investment and created more than 1,400 jobs through clean energy investments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Attracting clean energy manufacturing plants is part of the province&amp;#39;s Open Ontario Plan to build a clean energy economy that creates jobs and protects our environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We applaud Samco Solar for seizing this new business opportunity in Ontario&amp;#39;s clean energy economy. This is a great success story, benefiting all Ontarians by helping create the new solar projects that will produce clean energy, transform and modernize our electricity system and strengthen our economy,&amp;quot; said Brad Duguid, Minister of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ontario&amp;#39;s commitment to adding new sources of renewable energy has helped stimulate our business and create manufacturing jobs. Working with a solar powerhouse like SunEdison has provided Samco with a significant opportunity for expansion into the energy sector,&amp;quot; said David A. Pichard, vice president for solar business development, Samco Machinery Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;As we grow our solar business both in Ontario and globally, SunEdison is pleased to work with Canadian partners like Samco Machinery Ltd. We&amp;#39;ve been impressed with Samco&amp;#39;s expertise and level of professionalism. Their skilled workforce and their enthusiasm for solar manufacturing have made them an important player in the Ontario solar industry,&amp;quot; said Jason Gray, vice president, Canada for SunEdison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/cPjc87MgzHI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Report reveals water constraints now a boardroom issue for global corporations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	CDP Water Disclosure, a new program from the Carbon Disclosure Project, recently launched its first report on the impact of water constraints on the world&amp;rsquo;s largest corporations, clearly illustrating the significance and immediacy of water as a corporate issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CDP Water Disclosure sent its first annual questionnaire to 302 of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest companies asking for information on their water use and other water-related business issues. It received a 50 percent response rate with 122 of these responding publicly and a further 25 companies responding on a purely voluntary basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The information was requested on behalf of 137 institutional investors representing US$16 trillion in assets to increase transparency and accountability on water scarcity and other water related issues, and to inform the global market place on investment risks and commercial opportunities. The data will provide valuable insight into the strategies deployed by many of the largest companies in the world in relation to water use and will be used to help drive sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report, prepared by Environmental Resource Management (ERM), analyzes the public responses to the questionnaire and was officially launched at Bloomberg&amp;rsquo;s offices in London on November 12. The report findings show that water is already impacting business operations, with 96 percent of responding companies able to identify whether or not they are exposed to water risk and more than half of those reporting risks classifying them as current or near-term (1-5 years). 39 percent of companies are already experiencing detrimental impacts relating to water including disruption to operations from drought or flooding, declining water quality necessitating costly on-site pre-treatment, and increases in water prices, as well as fines and litigation relating to pollution incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Water security is already high on the corporate agenda with 67 percent reporting responsibility for water-related issues at the board or executive committee level. The majority of companies (89 percent) have already developed specific water policies, strategies and plans, and 60 percent have set water-related performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other CDP Water Disclosure report key findings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Business engagement on water issues differs widely across different industry sectors: 100 percent of companies in the chemicals sector responded compared with just 29 percent in the oil &amp;amp; gas, and construction, infrastructure &amp;amp; real estate sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Responses were received from companies in a total of 25 countries, with the most responses coming from the United States (59, 57 percent responding), the United Kingdom (14, 64 percent responding) and Japan (13, 45 percent responding). The highest response rates were from South Africa (100 percent), Germany (83 percent) and Switzerland (71 percent).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A high number of corporations (62 percent) are identifying a wide range of water related business opportunities in areas such as water management, water efficiency and reduction, and wastewater treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Just 53 percent of companies are able to identify whether they are exposed to water risks in their supply chains, as opposed to the high levels of awareness (96 percent) of water risks in their own operations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sectors reporting the greatest exposure to water risks include food, beverage &amp;amp; tobacco and metals &amp;amp; mining, with chemicals and technology &amp;amp; communications the least exposed. Physical risks to direct operations from drought and flooding were most frequently cited, but companies also recognize risks from changing regulations and reputational damage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Companies exhibiting best practice in water management include Anglo American, Colgate-Palmolive, Ford, GE, PG&amp;amp;E and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The launch of CDP Water Disclosure&amp;rsquo;s first report at Bloomberg&amp;rsquo;s offices in London, along with the availability of individual company responses at &lt;a href="http://www.cdproject.net/"&gt;www.cdproject.net&lt;/a&gt;,gives investors, companies, governments and other interested stakeholders a wealth of information on companies&amp;rsquo; water usage, the water-related risks and opportunities in their operations and supply chains, and their water management plans and performance targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Welcoming the launch of the first report, Jacqueline McGlade at the European Environment Agency, said: &amp;ldquo;Climate change is altering global water availability, meaning greater scarcity in some regions and more flooding in others. Such changes demand that we adapt our infrastructure and our consumption. It is encouraging to see in the Water Disclosure Report that many corporations have already started taking concrete measures. But we must facilitate this process by developing appropriate standards and tools to measure corporate water use and impacts across the whole supply chain.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Paul Dickinson, executive chairman at the Carbon Disclosure Project, also speaking at the launch, said: &amp;ldquo;This data provides valuable insight into the strategies deployed by many of the largest companies in the world in relation to water and is a first step in helping drive investment towards sustainable water use. The changing availability of water resource is presenting opportunities to business through demand for new infrastructure, products and services and now is the time to seize these opportunities, address water challenges and build resilience &amp;ndash; not once the well has run dry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gregory Wade, global chief supply chain officer for global brewer Molson Coors, a lead sponsor of CDP Water Disclosure, said: &amp;ldquo;Transparency must serve as the cornerstone for stimulating integrated watershed resource management and CDP Water Disclosure is perfectly positioned to normalize best practice and mediate between investors and companies in valuing risks and opportunities. As we move forward, companies must accept the responsibility for their own transparency and join in this effort to help advance what will hopefully emerge as a common water reporting standard benefitting all stakeholders.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anne Kvam, global head of ownership strategies, Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), a lead sponsor of the program, said: &amp;ldquo;As a diversified investor with a long-term outlook and investments in a range of sectors at risk from increasingly scarce water resources, we take water management seriously. Companies that fail to consider the impact of water scarcity and other water-related risks pose a financial risk to investments.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand for water has risen and is now projected to outstrip supply by up to 40 percent by 2030, and approximately 80 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population already live in areas where fresh water supply is not secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As the climate changes, assuring global water security for both humans and ecosystems will increasingly present opportunities to business through demand for new infrastructure, products and services. It will also bring risks including physical disruptions to operations and supply chains, changing regulatory regimes and reputational damage from misuse, or perceived misuse, of what is a shared resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Speakers and panelists at the launch event on November 12 included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		John Curtis, senior partner, sustainability &amp;amp; climate change at ERM&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Paul Dickinson, executive chairman at Carbon Disclosure Project&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Michael Liebreich, chief executive at Bloomberg New Energy Finance&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Jacqueline McGlade, executive director at the European Environment Agency (keynote speaker)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Colin Melvin, chief executive at Hermes Equity Ownership Services Ltd&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Sarah Mukherjee, director of environment at Water U.K.&lt;/li&gt;

            <title>Toyota outlines eco-car plans, battery research progress</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announced details of its plans for &amp;quot;eco-car&amp;quot; development and launches and of progress in next-generation secondary-battery research &amp;mdash; both part of environmental technology efforts aimed at limiting oil consumption and reducing carbon dioxide emissions through the use of electricity and other alternative energies.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span class="bnormal"&gt;Details&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;1. Hybrid Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC plans to introduce 11 models by the end of 2012, consisting of all-new models and redesigned models. Of the planned new models, one is a compact with fuel efficiency in excess of 40 km/L under the 10-15 Japanese test cycle.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	By early 2012, TMC plans to begin sales of a &amp;quot;Prius&amp;quot;-based PHV, mainly in Japan, the United States and Europe. Sales are targeted at more than 50,000 units annually, and the price for Japan is expected to be in the 3-million-yen range.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	3. Electric Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	In 2012, in addition to the U.S. market, an iQ-based EV will also be introduced in Japan and Europe. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Launch preparations call for road trials in Japan, U.S., and Europe starting in 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Launch in China is also being considered, with road trials planned for 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;Separately, the &amp;quot;RAV4 EV&amp;quot; concept, which was developed jointly with Tesla Motors, will be on display until November 28 at the Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, United States.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	4. Fuel Cell Vehicles&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is continuing development of a sedan-type fuel-cell hybrid vehicle (FCHV), with sales aimed to start in around 2015 in Japan, the U.S. and Europe &amp;mdash; markets in which hydrogen supply infrastructure is expected to develop. Although currently a price under 10 million yen seems attainable, TMC aims to further reduce costs to bring the vehicle to market at a more-affordable price.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	5. Next-generation Secondary Batteries&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is researching development of next-generation secondary batteries with performance that greatly exceeds that of lithium-ion batteries. Such research is aimed to help bring about the revolutionary advances in battery performance that will be necessary for the broad adoption of electric-motor-propelled eco-cars. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Solid-state batteries: TMC has successfully reduced what is known as particle resistance and has made progress toward creating full solid-state batteries in a promising compact package.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Metal-air batteries: TMC has determined the reaction mechanism of lithium-air batteries and has clarified its research policy regarding the batteries as rechargeable secondary batteries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;span class="normal"&gt;In January 2010, TMC established a division charged with studying production of next-generation batteries. &amp;nbsp;The division, with a staff of approximately 100 researchers, is accelerating its research.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC believes that eco-cars can have a positive impact on the environment only if they are widely used.&amp;nbsp;TMC will continue to improve the fuel efficiency of its conventional combustion-engine cars, which account for the majority of its sales, while raising performance, reducing costs and expanding the company&amp;#39;s product lineup. Within these efforts, hybrid technologies &amp;mdash; consisting of the basic technologies necessary for development of various eco-cars &amp;mdash; are positioned as key technologies to achieve both high fuel efficiency and driving performance, and to facilitate the use of various fuels with the aim of creating a low-carbon society through response to the need to diversify energy sources.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/WzuLMaHEDYI" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Chevrolet invests in clean energy projects across America</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Chevrolet announced last week that it will invest $40 million in various clean energy projects throughout America with a goal to reduce 8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The initiative is based on projects that promote energy savings, renewable energy, responsible use of natural resources and conservation in communities across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&lt;/a&gt;, 8 million metric tons equals the CO2 emissions of one year of electricity use in 970,874 homes or the annual carbon reduction from 1.7 million acres of pine forest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chevrolet&amp;rsquo;s clean energy investments to be implemented in the next three to five years may include projects such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Providing energy efficient technology such as smart energy sensors and solar panels to schools and other community-based facilities in need of upgrades to decrease carbon dioxide emissions and reduce heating bills.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Supporting wind farms and solar projects that deliver renewable energy to the grid and also help family farms increase their revenues per acre.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Capturing flammable methane from community landfills that delivers clean energy to the grid and improves local air quality and safety.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Contributing to forestry projects throughout America.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;GM has made great progress in reducing our environmental impact, but we know we can do more,&amp;rdquo; said General Motors CEO Dan Akerson. &amp;ldquo;Chevrolet&amp;rsquo;s investment is an extension of the environmental initiatives we&amp;rsquo;ve been undertaking for years because the solution to global environmental challenges goes beyond just vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This is an opportunity to connect with Chevy customers through clean energy projects that directly impact them,&amp;rdquo; Akerson said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM estimates its new carbon-reduction goal equates to the emissions in 2011 from driving the 1.9 million vehicles Chevrolet is expected to sell in the United States over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy is an iconic emblem of America and it is a big deal that it is stepping forward to address one of our greatest challenges &amp;ndash; moving us toward a low-carbon future,&amp;rdquo; said Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. &amp;ldquo;Chevy is clearly demonstrating that companies can act now and help propel clean energy solutions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since 1990, GM has decreased its manufacturing emissions by 60 percent. GM also has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to build fuel-efficient vehicles like the Chevrolet Cruze Eco, which gets an EPA-estimated 42 mpg on the highway, and the Chevy Volt electric car with extended-range capability. The Volt allows 25-50 miles of pure electric driving on a single charge after which a small gasoline engine/generator creates electricity for an additional 300 miles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy&amp;rsquo;s Volt and its clean energy investment both exemplify the bold leadership businesses can take today to address our changing climate,&amp;rdquo; Claussen said.&amp;rdquo; Its commitment to community-focused clean energy and energy efficiency investments will drive change and increase awareness across the country.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other GM initiatives include reducing water use by nearly 35 percent between 2005 and 2009 at manufacturing facilities worldwide; decreasing fossil fuel at GM plants by using landfill gas, hydro and solar power; recycling 90 percent of the waste the company generates; and operating 75 landfill-free facilities, more than half of its manufacturing plants globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chevy will be making investments through third-party organizations such as Bonneville Environmental Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Portland, Ore. To define project criteria and the program&amp;rsquo;s investment portfolio, GM has engaged environmental experts, non-government organizations and academics through the Climate Neutral Business Network. Advisors include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Bob Sheppard, vice president of corporate programs at Clean Air-Cool Planet&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Derik Broekhoff, vice president of policy at Climate Action Reserve&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mark Kenber, deputy CEO at The Climate Group&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Snehall Desai, Sustainability Marketer&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Janet Peace, vice president at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Eban Goodstein, director of the Center for Environmental Policy, Bard College&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Chevy understands that to lead in the environmental arena it needs to collaborate with experts from outside its industry,&amp;rdquo; said Goodstein. &amp;ldquo;Their engagement of NGOs and academia in development of the scope and strategy of this initiative shows their commitment to projects that will make the most impact across America&amp;rsquo;s communities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Verso Paper launches renewable energy project at Maine mill</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Verso Paper Corporation announced November 19 the launch of a $40 million Renewable Energy Project at its Bucksport, Maine, mill. This project will provide a 43 percent increase in thermal energy production from renewable biomass at the Bucksport Mill and will generate additional green power &amp;ndash; equivalent to the amount needed to supply electricity to 30,000 Maine households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This project represents what Verso stands for when it comes to our position as a green energy company and as a leader in environmental stewardship. We will have the ability to generate more green energy from renewable biomass, which reduces our carbon footprint, all while increasing overall energy efficiency,&amp;rdquo; says Verso president and chief executive officer Mike Jackson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bucksport Mill will achieve these energy efficiency improvements by replacing coal with biomass in the #8 Boiler and installing a new 25-megawatt turbine generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Partnering with people and organizations at the local, federal and state levels is a key element in making this project a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The forest products industry needs to change, and Verso is at the forefront of innovative practices such as improving energy efficiency by pursuing biofuel opportunities. Doing so also has the benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and reducing overall energy consumption in Maine. We&amp;rsquo;ve been working aggressively to expand renewable power generation and have been recognized nationally for our efforts to promote energy efficiency. Partnering with private industry like Verso is essential for us to meet our goals,&amp;rdquo; says Maine Governor John Baldacci.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Funding for the Bucksport Renewable Energy Project includes a grant from Efficiency Maine. Efficiency Maine is an independent trust that invests in cost-effective energy efficiency or alternative energy projects to reduce energy costs and improve Maine&amp;rsquo;s business environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This project illustrates Verso&amp;rsquo;s commitment to Maine and its surrounding community. Such an investment shows the company&amp;rsquo;s strong belief in this area, and also demonstrates its ability to adapt as a manufacturing business, thus keeping jobs at the mill. This project is another step in innovation that is helping to make Bucksport competitive in a tough global economy,&amp;rdquo; says Bucksport Town Manager Roger Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Verso is committed to continuing energy-saving efforts in Maine and company-wide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Bob Gemmer, technology manager with the Department of Energy Office of Industrial Technologies, says, &amp;ldquo;Verso is a great example of our industry partnership, the &lt;em&gt;Save Energy Now &lt;/em&gt;LEADER program. The company is fully committed to reducing energy intensity by 25 percent in 10 years and producing green power in a sustainable way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Bucksport Renewable Energy Project is scheduled to begin construction before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Verso&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based in Memphis, Tenn., Verso Paper Corporation is a leading North American producer of coated papers, including coated groundwood and coated freesheet, and supercalendered and specialty products. Verso&amp;rsquo;s paper products are used primarily in media and marketing applications, including magazines, catalogs and commercial printing applications such as high-end advertising brochures, annual reports and direct-mail advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/f2eWoPqByEw" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Honda suppliers earn environmental achievement awards</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	As part of its global initiative to reduce the impact of manufacturing on the environment, Honda presented its prestigious Green Factory Environmental Achievement Award to eight parts suppliers in North America that have excelled at conserving natural resources, reducing energy use and eliminating waste to landfills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda presented the awards during its 18th annual Environmental, Safety and Ergonomics Symposium held November 10-11 at Honda of America Manufacturing Inc.&amp;#39;s campus near Marysville, Ohio. In addition to recognizing top environmental achievements, the suppliers attended seminars and roundtable sessions on environmental topics ranging from energy and waste reduction to environmental compliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The awards recognize environmental stewardship among Honda&amp;#39;s nearly 600 parts suppliers in North America, and reflect Honda&amp;#39;s ongoing commitments to protect the environment through its products and operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Through this symposium and awards program, Honda encourages all suppliers to achieve excellence in energy reduction, pollution prevention and conservation of natural resources,&amp;quot; said Rich Spivey, senior manager in Honda&amp;#39;s North American Purchasing Division. &amp;quot;It is both gratifying and educational to see how our suppliers are benefitting society by working to reduce their impact on the environment.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Several award winners presented their initiatives to more than 100 suppliers attending the symposium, while many other companies attending the symposium had displays showcasing their environmental improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;2010 Honda Green Factory Environmental Achievement Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Conservation of Natural Resources&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;AK Steel Corp.&amp;#39;s Coshocton Works&lt;/strong&gt; restored more than 10 acres into native Ohio prairie land with a walking trail. The restored property at its facility in Coshocton, Ohio, includes nesting boxes for bluebirds and purple martins, as well as native flowers and grasses. The company plans to expand the prairie to more than 20 acres in the future. AK Steel produces flat-rolled steels for the automotive, appliance construction and other industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Energy Reduction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Delphi Electronics &amp;amp; Safety,&lt;/strong&gt; Reynosa, Mexico, significantly reduced utility usage by improving the efficiency of compressed air use, including eliminating leaks, reducing air pressure, and turning off equipment during non-production and peak periods of electricity use. This facility supplies immobilizers for Honda and Acura automobiles to prevent them from operating under certain conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Highland Industries, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Cheraw, S.C., reduced energy use with efficiency improvements in lighting, compressed air and steam systems. Highland supplies fabric for safety airbags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Neaton Auto Products Mfg., Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Eaton, Ohio, formed an &amp;quot;Energy Conservation Committee&amp;quot; to facilitate efficient use of equipment, compressed air, air conditioning chillers and use of injection molding presses. Neaton manufactures airbag modules, steering wheels, consoles and other plastic injected molded parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline"&gt;Pollution Prevention&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Celina Aluminum Precision Technology, Inc. (CAPT),&lt;/strong&gt; Celina, Ohio, reduced wastewater treatment sludge by 58 percent by assembling a team to evaluate pre-treatment operations. CAPT manufactures pistons, cylinder heads, lower blocks and brake knuckles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Nishikawa Standard Company, LLC,&lt;/strong&gt; Topeka, Ind., reduced landfill waste by 83 percent through the recycling and reuse of scrap rubber. Honda is the largest customer for its weather stripping, seals and other rubber materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;TS Trim Industries, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Canal Winchester, Ohio, reduced landfill waste by more than 60 percent through various activities that included recycling metal, wood and other materials, and by reducing waste in the use of adhesives. TS Trim manufactures door liners and other components for Honda and Acura automobiles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;Van Rob Stampings, Inc.,&lt;/strong&gt; Manchester, Tenn., became a zero-waste-to-landfill manufacturing facility by recycling packaging, wrapping, office paper, cafeteria waste and other materials. Van Rob manufactures metal stamped components and welded assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;u&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Honda in North America&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Based on a philosophy to build products close to customers, Honda began U.S. production of motorcycles in 1979 and automobiles in 1982 in Marysville, Ohio. Since then, the company&amp;#39;s manufacturing has grown to nine U.S. plants among 14 major manufacturing plants in North America. In addition to the Marysville and East Liberty auto plants in Ohio, Honda has established auto plants in Alliston, Ontario; El Salto, Mexico; Lincoln, Alabama, and Greensburg, Ind., and as a result, more than 83 percent of Honda and Acura cars and light trucks sold in the U.S. in 2009 were built in North America. Honda&amp;#39;s parts purchasing totaled more than $13 billion last year from nearly 600 North American suppliers. Honda vehicles are manufactured using domestic and globally-sourced parts.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>HPI Products, related company to pay $150,000 EPA penalty</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;HPI Products Inc., of St. Joseph, Mo., along with an affiliated property holding corporation and the owner of both companies, have agreed to pay a total of $150,000 in civil penalties, in addition to covering undetermined cleanup costs at six of their chemical processing and manufacturing facilities, to settle a series of alleged violations of state and federal environmental laws.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	HPI Products, a chemical and pesticide manufacturing company, and St. Joseph Properties, LLC, which owns most of HPI&amp;rsquo;s production and storage facilities, have agreed to pay $62,500 to the United States, and $62,500 to the State of Missouri to settle the civil claims, according to a consent decree lodged November 15 in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;William Garvey, who owns HPI Products and St. Joseph Properties, has agreed to pay $12,500 to the United States and $12,500 to the State of Missouri, according to the settlement. Garvey has also agreed to sell his collection of 12 automobiles and three boats and pay the proceeds of those sales to the United States and the State of Missouri.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Additionally, HPI Products will pay $5,980.30 to reimburse the State of Missouri for past costs incurred in responding to and overseeing previous chemical cleanup activities at the company&amp;rsquo;s facilities, and another $17,540 to the state for future oversight costs.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Together, the defendants have agreed through the settlement to cover the costs of a forthcoming environmental investigation and subsequent cleanup of HPI Products&amp;rsquo; contaminated facilities. Those facilities include HPI Products&amp;rsquo; main production plant at 222 Sylvanie, a processing facility at 317 W. Florence Road, and warehouses at 1301 S. 11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;th&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, 1421 S. 11&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;th&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, 1300 S. 8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;th&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, 424 S. 8&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;th&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, 313 S. 3&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;rd&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, and 417 S. 4&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial" size="2"&gt;th&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font face="Arial"&gt; Street, all in St. Joseph, Mo.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;Because each step of the forthcoming environmental investigation is dependent on the findings from the previous step, total cleanup costs cannot presently be estimated. However, EPA has estimated that costs for the investigation alone could exceed $500,000.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;HPI Products has a long history of enforcement actions taken by EPA Region 7 and the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR). In 2005 and twice in 2006, MDNR representatives inspected the company&amp;rsquo;s main production plant at 222 Sylvanie and found multiple hazardous waste violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). In 2007, EPA and MDNR representatives inspected the Sylvanie facility and other HPI facilities in the area and noted additional RCRA violations. Additional inspections and file reviews noted pollutant discharge violations of the federal Clean Water Act (CWA), and chemical reporting violations of the federal Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (EPCRA).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;On December 23, 2008, the U.S. Department of Justice and the State of Missouri filed a civil complaint against HPI Products in federal court in Kansas City, Mo., alleging a series of violations of CWA, RCRA and EPCRA, and applicable state law equivalents. Today&amp;rsquo;s consent decree settles those claims.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;In separate but related criminal cases prosecuted last year in U.S. District Court in Kansas City, Mo.:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&amp;middot; Garvey pleaded guilty on January 27, 2009, to violating the Clean Water Act. On September 1, 2009, he was sentenced to six months of confinement and six months in home detention, and ordered to pay a $100,000 criminal fine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;middot; HPI Products entered a corporate guilty plea on January 27, 2009, to violating the Clean Water Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. On March 24, 2010, the corporation was ordered to pay a $300,000 criminal fine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;middot; On August 31, 2009, HPI Products&amp;rsquo; vice president, Hans Nielsen, pleaded guilty to violating sections of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). On January 22, 2010, Nielsen was sentenced to three years&amp;rsquo; probation and ordered to pay a $4,000 criminal fine.
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;In his 2009 guilty plea, Garvey admitted that for nearly 20 years he instructed his employees at various HPI Products locations to wash wastes, spills and equipment rinses down floor drains which were connected to St. Joseph&amp;rsquo;s sewer system. Garvey did not authorize sufficient expenditures for the proper disposal of HPI Products&amp;rsquo; wastes until 2006.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;In HPI Products&amp;rsquo; 2009 guilty plea, the company admitted illegally storing numerous 55-gallon drums of hazardous waste, including chlordane, selenium and heptachlor, at its facilities without a permit.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;font face="Arial"&gt;The November 15 consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final approval by the federal court.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Tour of a 'green' tortilla chip manufacturing plant</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Lee Patrick Sullivan tours the Shearer&amp;#39;s tortilla chip factory, the world&amp;#39;s first LEED Platinum certified snack food plant, and interviews its manager, Ken Brower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It starts in the room where Shearer&amp;#39;s unloads its corn from trucks and cooks it using recycled heat from the infrared oven that&amp;#39;s used to bake the chips. That allows water to come into the cooking kettles at about 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The plant also uses real corn, right off the cob, not corn mash like some other plants. The room is lit using skylights and large windows, and the in-house lighting is adjusted according to the amount of natural light coming in. Brower says this lighting system is the key component that allows the factory to use 30 percent less energy than others of the same size. Brower says it allows the company to buy higher-quality materials and produce a better product than its competitors, while offering it to consumers at a competitive cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Brower says the energy-saving components aren&amp;#39;t all that revolutionary, just a lot of commonsense ideas that are being put together in a manufacturing plant for the first time. Brower says the reason other plants don&amp;#39;t have these features is because it would cost a lot of money to retrofit an existing building, Shearer&amp;#39;s was able to save some money by incorporating them into a new plant, but it is getting ready to put some of the same features into an older plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The centerpiece of the plant is its infrared oven, which bakes the chips before they are fried. Brower says the oven is built to save energy by drawing the air it heats from its own output. he compares it to a home chimney, which pulls in air from the bottom, heats it, and sends most of that eat up the chimney. This oven starts with air that has already been heated, so it does not require as much energy to reach the proper baking temperature. He says it&amp;#39;s the first one of its kind and about 47 percent more efficient than others on the market.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Energy management and green manufacturing in the food and beverage industry</title>
            <description>&lt;p id="eow-description"&gt;
	When people need energy, they often grab a snack. But have you ever thought about how snack foods could actually save energy?&lt;/p&gt;

	In Sustainable Snacks, Lee Patrick Sullivan looks at building practices and manufacturing practices that could change not only the food industry, but industry in general. Lee Patrick visits the world&amp;#39;s first LEED Platinum certified snack food factory in Ohio, one that uses the sun for most lighting and an infrared oven to heat its corn chip cooking water. He talks to Energy Secretary Steven Chu at the plant&amp;#39;s opening.&lt;br /&gt;
	Then he buys a Wisconsin man a beer at a sustainable brewery that uses solar power for both heating and beer production, and uses equipment that&amp;#39;s been repurposed from other plants. The factory and brewery owners think the practices he&amp;#39;s seen here can make for more energetic snacks, with less energy wasted.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>General Mills unveils 2015 sustainability goals, reports progress on 2010 goals </title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	From &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.generalmills.com%2FMedia%2FInside_General_Mills_archive%2Fwindpower_spain_6_1_2010.aspx&amp;amp;esheet=6510046&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=harnessing+wind+power&amp;amp;index=1&amp;amp;md5=b2d4012b05dc49a1b8e90840d817e185" target="_blank"&gt;harnessing wind power&lt;/a&gt; in Spain to &lt;a href="http://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.generalmills.com%2FMedia%2FVideos.aspx%3FNowPlayingId%3D%257bF3547CD6-C348-4BA3-9F0D-9798ED983763%257d&amp;amp;esheet=6510046&amp;amp;lan=en-US&amp;amp;anchor=reducing+water&amp;amp;index=2&amp;amp;md5=1e191dd46808251f878e2b9a6c47fcae" target="_blank"&gt;reducing water&lt;/a&gt; usage in Georgia, General Mills detailed its progress in four environmental sustainability areas on November 12, and announced new environmental sustainability goals for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Preserving and protecting the environment for generations to come is an important aspect of General Mills&amp;rsquo; mission of Nourishing Lives,&amp;rdquo; said Jerry Lynch, chief sustainability officer for General Mills. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re proud of the progress we&amp;rsquo;re making, and we are setting more aggressive goals for even greater progress in the next five years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="bwuline"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Global environmental sustainability goals for 2015&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s new, expanded environmental sustainability goals include the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;1. Reducing water usage by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;2. Reducing solid waste generation by 50 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;3. Reducing energy usage by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;4. Reducing greenhouse gas emission by 20 percent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The four global environmental sustainability goals measure the company&amp;rsquo;s global manufacturing operations using rates normalized per metric ton of product. The water usage goal is measured against a 2006 baseline, while the solid waste, energy and greenhouse gas goals are measured against a 2005 baseline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Mills has also established a U.S. transportation goal of reducing the amount of fuel used to ship each pound of product by fiscal 2015, using fiscal 2009 as a baseline. Achieving the U.S. transportation goal would reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions generated by shipping the company&amp;rsquo;s products by 35 percent by fiscal 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	General Mills also detailed its progress in each category through the end of the company&amp;rsquo;s 2010 fiscal year. Specifically, the company said it has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="bwmarginl1"&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its water usage rate by 9 percent &amp;ndash; nearly twice the 5 percent goal set in fiscal 2006;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its solid waste generation rate by 33 percent &amp;ndash; more than twice the 15 percent goal set in fiscal year 2005;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its energy consumption rate by 6 percent &amp;ndash; short of the company&amp;rsquo;s 15 percent goal set in fiscal 2005, and;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li class="bwlistitemmargb"&gt;
		&lt;b&gt;Reduced its greenhouse gas emission rate by 8 percent &amp;ndash; about half the company&amp;rsquo;s 15 percent reduction goal from fiscal 2005.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Our 2005 goals were aggressive,&amp;rdquo; said Lynch, &amp;ldquo;and we did not achieve them all. But our progress has been substantial and we are raising the bar. We are learning and improving our capabilities in this area every day. We want to set goals that will stretch us to do more.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company&amp;rsquo;s continuous improvement initiatives have been especially important in creating even better systems across the company, Lynch explained. &amp;ldquo;Those efforts have really increased our momentum in just the past two years,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;For example, all of the 6 percent reduction we have achieved in energy consumption came in just the last two years. We are gaining momentum, which in turn encourages us to set more aggressive goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are on a journey to stand among the most socially responsible consumer food companies in the world,&amp;rdquo; Lynch concludes. &amp;ldquo;We have a lot of work ahead. But by setting aggressive goals &amp;ndash; and continuing to work to advance our capabilities in this important area &amp;ndash; we are putting in place a road map to the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Smart grid efficiency could make 2010's energy usage 'disappear'</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Whenever smart grid experts talk about transforming the nation&amp;rsquo;s aging power grid, the focus is usually on the efficiency that will result. And for good reason &amp;mdash; the potential gains are so huge, they might just exceed our current electrical usage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At this week&amp;rsquo;s Advanced Energy 2010 Conference in New York City, GE&amp;rsquo;s Bob Gilligan laid out a scenario in which the total U.S. energy consumption and emissions saved between 2010 and 2030 could exceed the entire electrical consumption and electrical CO2 output for all of 2010. &amp;ldquo;The net result would be like 2010 never happened,&amp;rdquo; he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gilligan, vice president of digital energy for GE Energy Services, said that in addition to the energy and pollution savings, that scenario would create 140,000 sustainable new jobs and an electrical landscape that includes 3.3 billion fewer customer outage minutes. These improvements could result in savings of $65.7 billion from reduced power interruptions by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Granted, all this good news comes with an ever-growing backdrop of bad news. Gilligan noted that as cities continue to grow around the world, they will house more than 60 percent of the world&amp;rsquo;s population and consume a vast majority of its power by 2030 &amp;mdash; something that an electricity infrastructure designed a century ago can&amp;rsquo;t supply. For example, approximately half of the transformer equipment powering the U.S. grid is currently at or approaching the end of its design life, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is happening as global electricity demand is forecasted to increase 75 percent by 2030 &amp;mdash; with more than 40 percent of our emissions already coming from electricity generation. At the same time, costs are also rising &amp;mdash; in the U.S., rates increased an average of 42 percent between 2000 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The good news is that we are not talking gloom and doom,&amp;rdquo; he said, underscoring that the technology is ready now and deployable. The key to an energy revolution, he says is to take &amp;ldquo;measured, affordable evolutionary steps.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If that evolution begins now, Gilligan estimates that the power saved will be equal to the output of 64 average coal plants (500 megawatts each) while the CO2 impact will be the equivalent of taking over 25 million cars off the road. Another upside: &amp;ldquo;These are conservative adoption estimates,&amp;rdquo; he said, &amp;ldquo;so imagine the benefits if we move more quickly.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="large_img_wtext" sizcache="3" sizset="1"&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;span&gt;Baby steps start now:&lt;/span&gt; Click to enlarge. The smart grid is more than just smart meters. The pie charts indicate the level of adoption/deployment of other key smart grid technologies by 2030. They include: Smart meters, efficiency and reliability technologies, visualization tools to monitor energy use and fully integrated networks that automate power distribution functions.

            <title>EPA seeks to reduce GHG pollution from the largest industrial facilities</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is making available guidance and tools to help state and local air permitting authorities identify cost-effective pollution reduction options for greenhouse gases (GHGs) under the Clean Air Act. These tools are part of EPA&amp;rsquo;s common sense approach to GHG permitting of the largest emissions sources outlined this spring in the tailoring rule. GHG pollution threatens the health and welfare of all Americans, and contributes to climate change.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;EPA is working closely with its partners at the state and local levels to ensure permitting for greenhouse gases runs smoothly,&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo; said Gina McCarthy, assistant administrator for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office Air and Radiation. &amp;ldquo;&amp;lsquo;To identify GHG reduction options, EPA and the states are now ready to apply the same time-tested process they have used for other pollutants. This shows that the Clean Air Act can be used to reduce these gases in a cost effective way.&amp;rdquo;&amp;lsquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA recommends that permitting authorities use the best available control technology (BACT) process to look at all available emission reduction options for GHGs. After taking into account technical feasibility, cost and other economic, environmental and energy considerations, permitting authorities should narrow the options and select the best one. EPA anticipates that, in most cases, this process will show that the most cost effective way for industry to reduce GHG emissions will be through energy efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The guidance does not define or require a specific control option for a particular type of source because BACT is determined on a case-by-case basis. Instead, the guidance and resources provide the basic information that permit writers and applicants need to address GHGs. The guidance also provides examples of how permitting requirements could apply.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In January 2011, industries that are large emitters of GHGs, and are planning to build new facilities or make major modifications to existing ones, will work with permitting authorities to identify and implement BACT to minimize their GHGs. This includes the nation&amp;rsquo;s largest GHG emitters, such as power plants, refineries and cement production facilities. Emissions from small sources, such as farms and restaurants are not covered by these GHG permitting requirements.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	EPA welcomes public feedback on the guidance over the next few weeks on any aspect that contains technical or calculation errors or where the guidance would benefit from additional clarity.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>California wire manufacturer pleads guilty to criminal wastewater discharge</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that the Davis Wire Corporation of Irwindale, Calif. pleaded guilty to one count of negligent discharge of acidic pollutants into a publically owned treatment works, following an October 26 court decision in which Davis Wire was sentenced to pay $1.5 million in restitution to the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts (LACSD) for damage done to its sewer system, and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Investigators determined that Davis Wire, a manufacturer of galvanized wire, illegally discharged wastewater with acidic levels from its plant in Irwindale on a routine basis. A team of inspectors found that the Davis Wire discharges had, over time, impaired sewer lines to such an extent that the entire trunk line must be re-lined at a cost of more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Davis Wire has an extensive history of noncompliance since at least 2004, including repeated discharges of highly acidic wastewater,&amp;rdquo; said Jared Blumenfeld, EPA&amp;rsquo;s regional administrator for the Pacific Southwest. &amp;ldquo;Their illegal discharges put the surrounding community at risk by damaging the sewer pipes, potentially impacting public health and the environment.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The plea and sentence caps a joint investigation and prosecution effort by EPA&amp;rsquo;s Office of Criminal Enforcement, FBI, LACSD, Los Angeles County Public Works, Los Angeles County Fire Department, California Department of Toxic Substances Control and the U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;All companies must ensure their compliance with federal environmental regulations or face the consequences, as demonstrated by the sentencing of Davis Wire for a combined $1,525,000 million fine and restitution,&amp;rdquo; said Nick Torres, Special Agent in Charge of the Office of Criminal Enforcement for EPA&amp;rsquo;s Pacific Southwest region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The case opened in February 2008, when a LACSD employee detected acid wastewater (with a pH level of approximately 3.0) while working in the southern portion of the Irwindale Trunk Line. The LACSD traced the source of the discharge to the Davis Wire plant at 5555 Irwindale Avenue. Davis Wire&amp;rsquo;s industrial wastewater discharge permit with the Los Angeles County Sanitation District does not allow a discharge with a pH level below 6.0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Davis Wire uses sulfuric acid in the manufacturing process, and is required to neutralize the acid with a wastewater treatment system before sending it to the public sewer. However, throughout the months of February, March, April and May 2008, inspectors recorded acidic discharges between pH levels of 4.0 and 1.0. A total of 14 illegal discharges were recorded during this period. The investigation revealed that Davis Wire&amp;rsquo;s wastewater treatment system was in need of upgrades for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/cRRcdQM19hU" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Saint-Gobain and SAGE to build electrochromic glass plant in Minnesota</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Saint-Gobain Glass has acquired 50 percent of the equity of the U.S. company SAGE Electrochromics for the large-scale manufacture of electrochromic glass. Activated by a low-voltage current, electrochromic glass adapts its light and heat transmission &amp;ndash; and so its tint &amp;ndash; to the level of sunlight and the building&amp;#39;s ambient temperature, without hindering external visibility. It significantly reduces the amount of energy consumed for air conditioning, heating and lighting, and enhances occupant comfort and well-being. For architects, it creates an aesthetic and efficient alternative to the current and prevalent use of mechanical window shades and blinds which currently dominate the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Saint-Gobain Glass and SAGE will build the world&amp;#39;s first large-scale electrochromic glass plant in Faribault, Minn. The project which started in November 2010 will cost about 135 million US dollars. It will act as the spearhead for electrochromic technology worldwide. The new plant will have an annual production capacity of more than 370, 000 square meters (4 million square feet) of electrochromic glass with sizes ranging up to 1.5 x 3.5 meters (5 x 10 feet), much larger than currently available in the market. The plant is scheduled to begin production starting in mid-2012. Leveraging the resultant economies of scale, this innovative glass will be sold at an affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Currently, with more than 100 patents and 40 years&amp;#39; combined research experience, the two companies develop the market&amp;#39;s most widely recognized electrochromic glass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This alliance heralds the start of a new revolution in the habitat glass industry,&amp;quot; said Jean-Pierre Floris, senior vice president of Compagnie de Saint-Gobain and president of the Innovative Materials Sector. &amp;quot;Thanks to the partnership between Saint-Gobain and SAGE, we are providing electrochromic advanced glazing that will be environmentally significant and affordable. SAGE and Saint-Gobain, whose names are associated with some of the world&amp;#39;s most prestigious buildings, will now be providing the most efficient electrochromic glazing to the international market through the certified distribution networks of Sage and QUANTUM GLASS.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Until now, electrochromic glass has been an emerging product, not widely deployed due to cost and manufacturing challenges. This alliance will trigger economies of scale, making possible a new era of high-performance windows that are both eco-friendly and economically sound,&amp;quot; said John Van Dine, SAGE chief executive office. &amp;quot;We are combining the best science and capabilities of the world&amp;#39;s two leading electrochromic technologies, and capitalizing on Saint-Gobain&amp;#39;s glassmaking experience, to deliver a product that&amp;#39;s higher quality and more durable than ever before, at half the cost of today&amp;#39;s electrochromic products. This alliance will dramatically accelerate global adoption of this game-changing technology in both commercial and residential markets.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	SAGE will remain an independent company and continue to market its SageGlass products in North America where they are used in hundreds of up-market commercial, institutional and residential buildings. Saint-Gobain will market SageGlass under the QUANTUM GLASS brand in Europe. The two companies will work together to develop a marketing strategy for Asia and the rest of the world, leveraging Saint-Gobain&amp;#39;s distribution partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Two members of the Saint-Gobain management team &amp;ndash; Floris and Francois-Xavier Moser, Saint-Gobain Glass Solutions managing director &amp;ndash; will join the SAGE board of directors, which will also have two representatives of the existing shareholders as well as two independent directors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This strategic alliance will open up new prospects for architects and designers, by providing creative, affordable and mass-market glass solutions used for the design of comfortable, aesthetic, energy-saving and environmentally friendly buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/-ayooaPKM1o" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Tyson Foods, Syntroleum joint venture opens advanced biofuels plant in Louisiana</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Operations are underway at the new Dynamic Fuels plant, which is successfully converting animal fats and greases into high-quality renewable fuels, officials from Syntroleum Corporation and Tyson Foods Inc. announced on November 8. Production at the Geismar, La., plant began in early October and the volume currently being produced is 2,500 barrels per day and growing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic Fuels LLC is a 50/50 joint venture of Syntroleum and Tyson. Unlike the ethanol and biodiesel industries, which use food ingredients such as corn and soybean oil to produce fuel, Dynamic Fuels uses non-food-grade animal fats and greases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re very pleased with the progress at the plant and the quality of the fuel it&amp;rsquo;s producing,&amp;rdquo; said Jeff Webster, group vice president of Tyson&amp;rsquo;s Renewable Products Division. &amp;ldquo;This fuel offers the same benefits of synthetic fuels derived from coal or natural gas, including substantial performance and environmental advantages over petroleum-based fuels.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To date, the Geismar plant has manufactured renewable diesel with a cloud point as low as minus-26 degrees Fahrenheit and cetane as high as 88, more than twice that of the ASTM petroleum diesel specification. The facility&amp;rsquo;s renewable diesel fuel product meets all ASTM D975 specifications for diesel fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gary Roth, chief executive officer of Syntroleum, said, &amp;ldquo;Our U.S. plant is producing some of the highest quality diesel fuel in the world, and best of all, it is renewable with a carbon footprint 75 percent below that of petroleum diesel. We can also make renewable, high value specialty distillate products that can be used in a wide variety of applications such as dry cleaning, ink cartridges and drilling fluids, and we are actively pursuing these markets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first shipments of fuel started leaving the Geismar plant in October. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s been tremendous interest in our fuels and so far our customers include a range of fuel distributors and end users, including the U.S. military,&amp;rdquo; said Bob Ames, vice president of renewable energy for Tyson Foods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dynamic Fuels has been making jet fuel for testing by the Air Force Research Laboratory. This is the first renewable jet fuel to be tested by the Air Force that has been produced in a domestic commercial scale facility. &amp;ldquo;We look forward to working with the Air Force in its fuel certification program,&amp;rdquo; said Ames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Tyson and Syntroleum officials remain hopeful Congress will restore the $1 per gallon renewable diesel tax credit that expired in December 2009. Fuel from the Geismar plant qualifies for the credit, which would help the economic feasibility of the operation and help recover development costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;More consistent and timely action by Congress on this and other biofuels tax credits is needed to provide stability and encourage the growth of the advanced biofuels industry, which is poised to help reduce the nation&amp;rsquo;s dependence on foreign oil,&amp;rdquo; said Webster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new facility uses Syntroleum&amp;rsquo;s Bio-Synfining Technology to produce the renewable fuels from non-food grade animal fats produced or procured by Tyson Foods, such as beef tallow, pork lard, chicken fat and greases. The plant is designed to produce up to 75 million gallons of renewable fuels per year. The operation currently has 44 permanent full-time positions on site and maintains 13 full-time start-up support personnel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Syntroleum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Syntroleum Corporation owns the Syntroleum Process for Fischer-Tropsch (FT) conversion of synthesis gas derived from biomass, coal, natural gas and other carbon-based feedstocks into liquid hydrocarbons, the Synfining Process for upgrading FT liquid hydrocarbons into middle distillate products such as synthetic diesel and jet fuels, and the Bio-Synfining technology for converting animal fat and vegetable oil feedstocks into middle distillate products such as renewable diesel and jet fuel using inedible fats and greases as feedstock. The 50/50 venture &amp;ndash; known as Dynamic Fuels &amp;ndash; was formed to construct and operate multiple renewable synthetic fuels facilities, with production on the first site beginning in 2010. The company plans to use its portfolio of technologies to develop and participate in synthetic and renewable fuel projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Tyson Foods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tyson Foods Inc., founded in 1935 with headquarters in Springdale, Ark., is one of the world&amp;#39;s largest processors and marketers of chicken, beef and pork, the second-largest food production company in the Fortune 500 and a member of the S&amp;amp;P 500.

            <title>GM publishes 'Blue Paper' for sustainable urban mobility</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	On November 7, General Motors published its &amp;quot;Blue Paper&amp;quot; for sustainable urban mobility -&amp;nbsp;a road map for overcoming mobility and urbanization challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Blue Paper addresses the growing challenges associated with rising urbanization and the greater demand for transportation with respect to energy, the environment, safety, traffic congestion and land use. It envisions a new automobile DNA based on electrification and connectivity, and promises a cleaner, safer and more convenient future for urban transportation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;GM&amp;rsquo;s Vision of Sustainable Urban Mobility&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Blue Paper integrates learnings and feedback from GM&amp;rsquo;s six &amp;ldquo;Drive to 2030&amp;rdquo;: Sustainable Urban Mobility forums, which took place from May to October at the SAIC-GM Pavilion at World Expo 2010 Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Blue Paper is an important document that integrates the learnings from our forums and participation in Expo 2010, which have provided a compelling vision of the future of the automobile and urban communities,&amp;rdquo; according to Kevin Wale, President and Managing Director of the GM China Group. &amp;ldquo;This vision, which GM is proud to document in the Blue Paper, serves as a roadmap to the electrification, connectivity, creative design, and advanced innovation strategies that will lead the world to sustainable urban mobility by 2030.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In GM&amp;rsquo;s vision of sustainable urban mobility, vehicles of the future will be increasingly powered by electricity, connected continuously to the communications infrastructure, electronically controlled, autonomously driven when desired, and flexibly designed to meet specific usage requirements. With this vision, GM proposes specific objectives for future mobility. Driving in the future will become cleaner, safer, less petroleum-dependent, more convenient, and more fun and fashionable than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;b&gt;Electrification, Connectivity, Creative Design will Change Automobile DNA&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Electrification, connectivity and creative design are key components of the technology solutions that GM has offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is important that those with a stake in the future act now to achieve a new vision of sustainable personal mobility,&amp;rdquo; said Wale. &amp;ldquo;By electrifying, connecting, and redesigning our vehicles &amp;ndash; and by integrating them with the energy, communications, and transportation infrastructure &amp;ndash; we will ensure that future vehicles are in harmony with society&amp;rsquo;s needs.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Three new-energy vehicles &amp;ndash; the Chevrolet Volt, EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) concept, and Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell electric vehicle &amp;ndash; which GM is showing at EVS25, demonstrate the progress that the company has made in electrification, connectivity and creative design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;A Call for the Promotion of Sustainable Urban Mobility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	The Blue Paper offers eight recommendations for overcoming the challenges associated with the rising demand for personal mobility and growing urbanization:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Accelerate and encourage the move to the electrification of the automobile, including the development of key vehicle components, a smart power grid, and a comprehensive urban recharging infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Increase the diversity of energy sources, particularly the development of a broad array of renewable sources, to support low-emission pathways to electrification.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Leverage connectivity by ensuring a high-quality wireless communications infrastructure and encouraging the rapid development of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and related intelligent transportation technologies.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Develop a sophisticated, integrated, intelligent transportation system that dynamically manages large transportation flows using the latest communications and computer controls.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Integrate electrically powered, connected vehicles into a multi-modal transport system that incorporates sophisticated inter-city transport, comprehensive subway systems, traditional vehicle movement, and specialized smaller urban vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Align government tax, regulatory, and procurement policies to support the vision of connected electrically driven vehicles. Specific globally consistent codes and standards should be developed. Government organizations should also support funding to encourage continued electric vehicle research and development and consumer incentives to support the transition to new energy vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Begin to optimize the physical infrastructure to support new urban vehicles through active collaboration and cooperation among urban planning authorities, think tanks, academic institutions, automotive companies, and infrastructure companies.&lt;br /&gt;
		Identify a series of &amp;ldquo;lighthouse&amp;rdquo; projects to rapidly demonstrate the viability and potential of connected electrically driven vehicles in a controlled environment such as an eco-city or small town.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Realizing the vision of sustainable mobility requires cooperation among government institutions, the automotive industry, infrastructure developers, and the academic community. Through its eight recommendations, GM is committed to working closely with stakeholders to drive the automotive industry to a sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM is showcasing its leadership in electric vehicle technology at EVS25, which runs from November 4-9. In line with the theme of its stand &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;The Road to the Future&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; it is introducing the Chevrolet Volt extended-range electric vehicle, the EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) concept, and the Chevrolet Equinox Fuel Cell electric vehicle. All three vehicles were part of GM&amp;rsquo;s participation in Expo 2010 from May 1-October 31. During EVS25, GM is also hosting a test drive of the Volt and Equinox Fuel Cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/ZF3wroBmJqo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For almost 40 years, the world&amp;rsquo;s population has faced an indisputable fact: our energy needs are outpacing our supply. And now, the need for new energy technologies is more urgent than ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	When GE Global Research&amp;rsquo;s Bob King built his first electric car in 1972, he didn&amp;rsquo;t have the barest inkling of the energy problems yet to come &amp;mdash; he just thought it was a cool idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As an undergraduate at Pennsylvania&amp;rsquo;s Grove City College, King wrote a paper that claimed we would be driving electric vehicles within his lifetime. &amp;ldquo;After I graduated, suddenly I had some extra time, so I went back and wondered if what I wrote back in [college] made sense,&amp;rdquo; he told GE Reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working with a Volkswagen chassis, a DC motor, and lead acid batteries, King jerry-rigged an electric car that could rumble down the road for up to 50 miles on a single charge. Since the commute to his new job at GE was just 20 miles, he could make it there and back with a few miles to spare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But as the energy crisis of the 1970s took root, King realized that he was almost unique on the road: &amp;ldquo;I was not waiting in line for gas like so many of my colleagues were.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Thus began his thirty-year quest to build a better electric vehicle. In late 1979, GE won a contract with the Department of Energy to build more efficient cars, and King was appointed project engineer for a new hybrid test vehicle. He sweated over batteries that weighed 700 pounds, and struggled to find ways to keep costs down and make the cars affordable for the average consumer. And since the energy crisis was in full swing, he figured that demand would make his dream of an electric-car world an inevitability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Then, in the early 1980s, everything changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;I thought that in five years, maybe [EVs] would be commercially viable,&amp;rdquo; King says. &amp;ldquo;But once the price of gas settled at a dollar a gallon, there was no shortage of gasoline. The energy crisis was over, and everyone went back to consuming gas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nevertheless, concerns about air pollution and global warming eventually brought EVs back into the public eye. In partnership with Ford, King and his GE team switched gears, focusing on reducing emissions by larger vehicles &amp;mdash; first vans, then heavy industrial mining trucks and buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There was no way that the emission problem was going to go away overnight,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;So I changed the thrust of the program to what can we do to minimize emissions.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Under King&amp;rsquo;s leadership, GE proved it was technically feasible to greatly reduce emissions on a public transit bus, which led to New York&amp;rsquo;s first hybrid buses in 1996. It paved the way for today&amp;rsquo;s hybrid buses and established the emissions requirements for New York City&amp;rsquo;s hybrid transit buses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now at last, the EV focus as returned to consumer vehicles. After thirty-plus years, King still recalls when he thought such cars were merely five years away. He&amp;rsquo;s a little older and a little wiser, but he&amp;rsquo;s still convinced that electric cars are the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We had the hybrids in the late &amp;lsquo;70s and pure electrics, but the battery technology still wasn&amp;rsquo;t there,&amp;rdquo; he says. &amp;ldquo;Now we&amp;rsquo;re seeing the battery technology has improved, and we&amp;rsquo;re looking at a 100-mile range on a single charge. We&amp;rsquo;re not all going to be driving electric vehicles in five years, but a great deal of people will. Especially with a second car, which many people use to drive less than forty miles a day.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Panasonic invests $30M in Tesla; companies strengthen collaborative relationship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Panasonic Corporation and Tesla Motors&amp;nbsp;on November 3 announced that Panasonic has invested $30 million in Tesla. The investment was made through the purchase of Tesla common stock in a private placement at a price of $21.15 per share. The investment builds upon a multi-year collaboration of the two companies to accelerate the market expansion of the electric vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Panasonic is the world&amp;rsquo;s leading battery cell manufacturer and a diverse supplier to the global automotive industry. Tesla currently uses Panasonic battery cells in its advanced battery packs and has collaborated with Panasonic on the development of next generation battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles. While Tesla&amp;rsquo;s current battery strategy incorporates proprietary packaging using cells from multiple battery suppliers, Tesla has selected Panasonic as its preferred lithium-ion battery cell supplier for its battery packs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Panasonic aims to be the number one Green Innovation Company in the Electronics Industry by 2018, the 100th anniversary of our founding,&amp;rdquo; said Naoto Noguchi, president of Energy Company, a unit of Panasonic responsible for the battery cell business. &amp;ldquo;Our sophisticated lithium-ion battery cell technology, combined with Tesla&amp;rsquo;s market-leading EV powertrain technology, helps us fulfill this goal by promoting sustainable mobility. We are proud to strengthen our relationship with Tesla Motors.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is an honor and a powerful endorsement of our technology that Panasonic, the world&amp;rsquo;s leading battery cell manufacturer, would choose to invest in and partner with Tesla,&amp;rdquo; said Tesla CEO and co-founder Elon Musk. &amp;ldquo;Panasonic offers the highest energy-density cells and industry-leading performance with cutting edge Nickel-type cathode technology. We believe our partnership with them will enable us to further improve our battery pack while reducing cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to producing its own vehicles, Tesla also builds electric powertrains, including battery packs, for other automobile manufacturers. Panasonic and Tesla intend to explore joint marketing and sales of battery packs that would be designed and assembled by Tesla using Panasonic&amp;rsquo;s battery cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Panasonic &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Panasonic Corporation is a worldwide leader in the development and manufacture of electronic products for a wide range of consumer, business, and industrial needs. Based in Osaka, Japan, the company recorded consolidated net sales of 7.42 trillion yen (US$79.4 billion) for the year ended March 31, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Tesla Motors &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Tesla&amp;#39;s goal is to produce a full range of electric cars, from premium sports cars to mass market vehicles &amp;ndash; relentlessly driving down the cost of electric vehicles. It is currently the only automaker in the U.S. that builds and sells highway-capable EVs in serial production. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla designs and manufactures EVs and EV powertrain components. Tesla has delivered more than 1,300 Roadsters to customers in North America, Europe and Asia. The Tesla Roadster accelerates faster than most sports cars yet produces no emissions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Snyderâs of Hanover begins construction of solar farm</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover will begin construction on a solar farm that will be the largest ground-based solar energy system in Pennsylvania, with more than 16,000 panels spanning 20 acres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After gaining approval from the Penn Township Planning and Zoning Board to build the solar farm, Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover plans to begin construction in November. The solar farm will be built on the field across Route 116 from the plant and corporate headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re incredibly eager to take the next step in reducing our carbon footprint. This is an exciting event for our company, community and environment,&amp;rdquo; said Jim Butt, vice president of technical services at Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover and project manager for the solar project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The solar farm will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in excess of 230 million pounds of carbon dioxide over a 25-year period. As a comparison, the energy created from the solar field equals more than 111 million miles not driven by a medium-sized car and more than 11 million trees would need to be planted to equal the same level of carbon dioxide reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are always looking for ways to be a greener and environmentally friendly company and the solar farm is an important step. The solar field joins other Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover sustainability initiatives, including compostable packaging, and takes the company one step closer to achieving our five-year sustainability goals established last year. It demonstrates that we can still be passionate about pretzels and better-for-you snack foods while caring for our environment,&amp;rdquo; said Carl E. Lee, Jr., president and CEO of Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The global leader in pretzels and the nation&amp;rsquo;s second-largest snack food company, Snyder&amp;rsquo;s of Hanover was founded in 1909 and is a privately held company that employs more than 2,250 associates and operates nearly 1,900 distribution routes nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Snyder&amp;rsquo;s is headquartered in Hanover, Pa., also the location of its flagship snack food manufacturing and distribution center where products are produced and distributed to the eastern half of North America, the Caribbean, Central and South America, and Europe. The Goodyear, Ariz., plant produces products for the Western half of the United States and Pacific Rim countries. The Jeffersonville, Indiana &amp;ldquo;Krunchers!&amp;rdquo; plant produces and distributes Krunchers!kettle potato chips, Jays potato chips, and Grandetortilla chip products primarily for the Midwest, Central, and Eastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>N.H. concrete company faces penalties for Clean Water Act violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The United States Attorney&amp;rsquo;s Office has filed a complaint on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency in federal district court in New Hampshire against Torromeo Industries Inc. for Clean Water Act (CWA) violations at its sand, gravel, and stone mining operation and ready-mix concrete plant in Kingston, N.H.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England office, Torromeo Industries, Inc., whose headquarters is in Methuen, Massachusetts, violated the CWA by discharging stormwater and process water into wetlands and waterways, including the Little River, without the required authorization under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The complaint proposes that Torromeo pay a penalty of up to $37,500 per day, per violation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The complaint grew out of a joint inspection with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services on April 9, 2009. Federal and State inspectors found that the company discharged process waste waters, and storm water without proper permits. The inspectors observed that the company failed to implement best management practices to minimize the impacts of storm water that ran off the site during rain events. The violations at the facility have been ongoing for decades and include:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; discharging process water, without authorization, from the mid 1970s through present; and&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; discharging stormwater associated with industrial activity, without authorization, from the mid 1990&amp;rsquo;s through December 19, 2009;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Stormwater runoff and process water discharges from the sand and gravel and ready-mix concrete industry are a significant source of water pollution,&amp;rdquo; said Curt Spalding, regional administrator of EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England office. &amp;ldquo;This industry plays a very important role in protecting water quality by taking the appropriate steps to prevent pollution, and we will continue our work to ensure compliance with these practices.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Without onsite controls, runoff from ready-mix concrete and sand and gravel facilities can flow directly to the nearest waterway and can cause water quality impairments such as siltation of rivers, beach closings, fishing restrictions, and habitat degradation. As storm water flows over these sites, it can pick up pollutants, including sediment, used oil, pesticides, solvents and other debris. Polluted runoff can harm or kill fish and wildlife and can affect drinking water quality.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In August 2009, EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England Office and the Department of Justice entered into a $2.75 million settlement with Aggregate-Industries Northeast Region, Inc. to resolve similar violations of the Clean Water Act at many of that company&amp;rsquo;s concrete manufacturing facilities in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. That penalty was the largest ever assessed to a nationwide ready-mix concrete company for storm water violations under the Clean Water Act, and is part of the Region&amp;rsquo;s increased enforcement efforts in this industrial sector.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Kimberly-Clark ranked among greenest companies in the U.S.</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Kimberly-Clark Corporation made the most environmental progress within the consumer products/car category among the top 100 companies over the past year, according to Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s 2010 Green Rankings of the largest 500 companies. Newsweek ranked Kimberly-Clark No. 76, up from No. 120 in 2009 among the largest 500 companies, and No. 8, up from No. 10 in 2009 among the consumer products/car category companies this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The second annual study by the leading weekly news magazine measures the environmental performance of the 500 largest publicly traded companies based on each company&amp;rsquo;s resource use and emission levels, environmental policies and strategies, and peer reputation.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Kimberly-Clark is honored to be ranked among the top 100 greenest companies in the U.S., as measured by Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s comprehensive research,&amp;rdquo; said Suhas Apte, vice president of global sustainability at Kimberly-Clark. &amp;ldquo;This ranking reflects our ongoing commitment to sustainability and to continuously improving our environmental performance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Kimberly-Clark earned an overall Green Score of 80.65 out of 100 in Newsweek&amp;rsquo;s 2010 Green Rankings. The score is based on the ranking of a company&amp;rsquo;s global environmental impact, based on more than 700 metrics; an extensive assessment of environmental initiatives; and a reputation survey of CEOs, environmental officers and other experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The complete Newsweek rankings, as well as the related story and methodology, can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/green-rankings.html"&gt;http://www.newsweek.com/feature/2010/green-rankings.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;About Kimberly-Clark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	Kimberly-Clark and its well-known global brands are an indispensable part of life for people in more than 150 countries.

            <title>Massachusetts power station cited for Clean Water Act violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A power station located in Holyoke, Mass. faces up to $177,500 in Clean Water Act (CWA) fines for allegedly discharging muddy storm water and other pollutants into the Connecticut River.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the Mt. Tom Generating Company, LLC violated its federally issued permit by exceeding permit discharge limits over a five month period of time. The company was performing construction work at the coal-fired power plant facility during this period of time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is imperative that companies who discharge their wastewaters to our waterways fully comply with applicable permit requirements,&amp;rdquo; said Curt Spalding, regional administrator of EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England Office. &amp;ldquo;EPA will continue enforcing and monitoring permit requirements that are necessary to improve water quality in our rivers, lakes and estuaries.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Rainwater running off construction sites can carry sediments, oil and other pollutants which contaminate nearby streams, ponds and rivers. Sediments and chemicals can also contribute to fish die-offs, toxic algae blooms, contaminated shellfish beds and closed swimming beaches.&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Rhode Island concrete manufacturer faces $177,500 fine for EPA violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has proposed that a concrete manufacturing plant in Pawtucket, R.I., pay a penalty of up to $177,500 for illegally discharging stormwater and process water in violation of the federal Clean Water Act.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England office, PRM Concrete Corporation violated the Clean Water Act by discharging stormwater and process water to municipal catch basins and to the Seekonk River without the required authorization under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit. The violations at PRM occurred from October 2005 through August 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Specifically, the company:&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; discharged stormwater associated with industrial activity, without authorization, from October 2005 until August 2008;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; discharged process water, without authorization, from October 2005 until May 2007; and&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;bull; failed to file for permit coverage for the stormwater discharges from its facility until August 2008.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The complaint grew out of an inspection of the School Street plant on May 14, 2007. PRM informed EPA towards of the end of September that it had ceased operations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Stormwater runoff from industry often carries sediment, debris and other pollutants into nearby waterways,&amp;rdquo; said Curt Spalding, regional administrator of EPA&amp;rsquo;s New England office. &amp;ldquo;It is everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility to protecting our waters and it is up to industry to assess the adequacy of their own stormwater controls.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The Clean Water Act requires that many industrial operations, such as ready-mix concrete plants, obtain discharge permits and implement controls to prevent the facilities from discharging pollutants into nearby waterways through stormwater runoff. Each site must develop and maintain a stormwater pollution prevention plan to put in place these practices. Without controls, contaminated stormwater runoff flowing from these sites contributes to degraded water quality that can harm or kill fish and wildlife, and leave the water unhealthy for swimming, fishing and drinking.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;

            <title>Ford taps experts to examine opportunities, challenges of electric cars</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company on October 29 convened key experts from the city of Chicago and ComEd to examine critical issues related to consumer adoption of electric vehicles. Ford has been working to engage utilities, city and state governments and infrastructure providers in efforts to promote the commercialization of electrified vehicles to reduce CO2 emissions and increase energy security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Ford has an aggressive plan to bring five new electrified vehicles to market over the next two years including the Transit Connect Electric later this year and the Ford Focus Electric in 2011,&amp;quot; said Sherif Marakby, director of electrification program and engineering, Ford Motor Company. &amp;quot;There is incredible excitement for electric vehicles in the Chicago area. To support the rollout and acceptance of these vehicles in Chicago and across the country, it is critical to work with local utilities and cities to make sure the necessary electric infrastructure and grid is ready for both vehicles and consumers.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ford plans to work with utilities as well as state and local officials to address issues related to the permitting and regulations that can support electric vehicle infrastructure. An easy charging station permitting process is considered an important element for electric vehicle acceptance in the Chicago area, Illinois and across the country. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Electric vehicles will be a key new technology in helping to reach the goals of the Chicago Climate Action Plan,&amp;quot; said Suzanne Malec-McKenna, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Environment. &amp;quot;We are excited about bringing electric vehicles to Chicago so that residents and businesses can take full advantage of the benefits these vehicles offer.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &amp;quot;Charging Into the Future &amp;ndash; Ford Electric Vehicle Tour,&amp;quot; which kicked off at Portland State University in Portland, Ore., last month, is visiting 14 key cities to promote Ford&amp;#39;s electric vehicle strategy as well as educate consumers about what to expect from electrified automobiles and what is needed from the public and private sector to support this new technology. Chicago and Detroit were the only two Midwest cities included in the tour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over the next two years, Ford will introduce the Transit Connect Electric small commercial van (2010), Focus Electric passenger car (2011), two third-generation lithium-ion battery hybrids (2012) and a plug-in hybrid (2012). These vehicles will achieve breakthrough efficiency; some, like the pure battery electric Transit Connect Electric and Focus Electric, will use no gasoline at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electrification is an important piece of Ford&amp;#39;s overall product sustainability strategy that features a range of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel technologies including EcoBoost engines, six-speed transmissions, electric power-assisted steering, aerodynamic improvements and light-weighting materials. Ford&amp;#39;s electrification strategy also leverages the most fuel-efficient powertrains, the most technically competent hybrids and global vehicle platforms in order to develop affordable, fuel-efficient choices for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/Os7Xc7hq-Gs" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toro partners with ATK to develop fuel cell-powered utility vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Toro Company was selected by ATK, an aerospace and defense company, to help design and build two fuel cell powered utility vehicles with advanced hydrogen storage technology. The project is part of a contract awarded to ATK by the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division, which is collaborating with the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) to coordinate hydrogen storage development efforts for the U.S. Department of Energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As partner in the project, Toro provides extensive operational experience in the area of fuel cell technologies having recently completed a three-year demonstration with the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA). The NYSERDA project used three prototype hydrogen-powered Toro Workman utility vehicles at various sites, including Niagara Falls State Park, Bethpage State Park and Rockefeller Plaza Government Center. These vehicles operated reliably in shuttling workers and grounds equipment, hauling turf materials, and assisting with refuse removal. The demonstration proved fuel cells technically viable and feedback from operators was consistently positive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With proven experience in mobile fuel cell technology and off-road utility vehicle application, Toro caught the attention of ATK&amp;rsquo;s Center for Energy and Aerospace Innovation (CEAI), based in Ronkonkoma, New York. Toro&amp;rsquo;s Center for Advanced Turf Technology (CATT) will assist in designing two operational machines based on the Toro Workman chassis and similar to what the company successfully demonstrated in New York. The group will also provide technical expertise on end-use applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re excited to partner on this project to leverage our field experience and further our efforts in the development of alternative fuel solutions,&amp;rdquo; said Dana Lonn, director of Toro&amp;rsquo;s CATT Group. &amp;ldquo;Our motivation in alternative energy is to reduce emissions, hydraulic leaks and noise levels for our customers. Therefore, we need to remain aggressive in identifying the best technologies to deliver these results at a competitive price.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The fuel cell utility vehicles, powered by a solid hydrogen storage system, are scheduled for delivery later this fall to the DLA for a 12-month operational demonstration. During this time, the vehicles will retrieve and transport materials between warehouses with data being collected to better understand the performance, durability and sustainability of the hydrogen fuel cell system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Shaped by concerns over energy usage and the environment, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 requires that the U.S. Department of Defense reduce oil consumption rates by 20 percent before the end of 2015. The energy law also establishes a hydrogen and fuel cell program with a goal of producing commercial fuel cell vehicles and developing hydrogen infrastructure by 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/3hRA3_iPK8c" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Will the cost of electric cars come down? A Q&amp;A session with A123</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/how-far-will-your-ev-go-it-depends-how-fast-you-charge-it/" jquery1288179281256="8"&gt;Astonishing fuel efficiency&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/drive-an-ev-slash-the-co2/" jquery1288179281256="9"&gt;reductions in CO2 pollution&lt;/a&gt; and the ability to &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-unveils-residential-wattstation-ev-charger/" jquery1288179281256="10"&gt;charge your battery at home&lt;/a&gt; are just a few of the benefits that electric vehicles offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Of course, the only step left between us and a world filled with electric vehicles is actual adoption of EVs by drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Right now, EVs are expensive and recent consumer data shows that 69 percent of consumers consider price the most important factor in purchasing a vehicle. Most of them expect to pay less than $30,000 for an EV &amp;mdash; which presents a serious problem, given that the cheaper EVs &lt;a href="http://gigaom.com/cleantech/at-33k-nissan-leaf-to-be-one-of-cheapest-electric-cars-in-u-s/" jquery1288179281256="11"&gt;currently cost around $33,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 250px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;

		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/a123.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Good Connections:&lt;/span&gt; A123 was born out of the research labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Government officials, environmentalists, and industry leaders hope that as demand for EVs rises, economies of scale will reduce production costs enough to make them affordable for the average consumer. But critics say the &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735804575536242934528502.html?KEYWORDS=A123+Systems" jquery1288179281256="12"&gt;EV industry faces technological barriers&lt;/a&gt; that will mean cost reductions may be at least ten years away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE Reports caught up with Andy Chu, a vice president at &lt;a href="http://www.a123systems.com/" jquery1288179281256="13"&gt;A123 Systems&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leading manufacturers of electric car batteries. With a &lt;a href="http://www.gereports.com/ge-boosts-battery-and-hybrid-bets/" jquery1288179281256="14"&gt;recent investment from GE&lt;/a&gt;, A123&amp;prime;s planned production facilities will be able to supply lithium ion batteries for 500,000 plug-in EVs a year by 2013. But the question remains as to whether EV costs will decrease quickly and substantially enough for consumers to buy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: The electric car&amp;rsquo;s battery accounts for almost half of the production costs, and can raise the sticker price thousands of dollars. What makes the battery so expensive?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: It&amp;rsquo;s the cost of the equipment, the materials that go into the battery, labor, and the processing costs. And some costs related to testing. But it&amp;rsquo;s really dominated by materials, processing, and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: Can any of these factors be reduced with economies of scale?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: The battery separator uses a polymer material, which isn&amp;rsquo;t very expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s when you make it into a specific form that it becomes expensive. Over time, as people improve the processing, it will become less and less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, electronics are already mass-produced commodities, and you can reduce the cost as you increase the production, and design better circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;
	&lt;tbody sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="2"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="2" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/An-A123-Systems-employee-ch.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Charged up:&lt;/span&gt; A123 Systems, seen above, is also developing smart grid applications, such as utility-scale energy storage,&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: That leaves labor and the raw materials. Specialized labor costs may well be fixed. But what about critics&amp;rsquo; focus on materials?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: For the lithium ion battery, &amp;hellip; &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703735804575536242934528502.html?KEYWORDS=A123+Systems" jquery1288179281256="15"&gt;nickel, cobalt, and manganese [have been cited]&lt;/a&gt; as the primary costs. And those are three of the higher cost items. When you look at laptops and cell phone batteries, they use those materials as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: So demand could keep the costs of those materials high.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: In theory. But A123 uses different materials [in our batteries]. We use a &lt;a href="http://a123systems.com/#/news/news110" jquery1288179281256="16"&gt;patented nanophosphate technology&lt;/a&gt;. Nanophosphate is a form of lithium ion phosphate. And instead of [the very expensive] nickel, manganese, and cobalt, we use iron. And iron is obviously less expensive. Which gives you reason to believe that the iron-based battery will be less expensive in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;GER: These aren&amp;rsquo;t the only raw materials in high demand, however&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Chu: The cathode material is only a portion of the cost. There are other materials involved, such as copper. Those add to the cost. Still, industry expectation is for far more significant cost reductions.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Toyota, three partner firms start joint battery-to-battery recycling</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC), Toyota Chemical Engineering Company Ltd. (Toyota Chemical Engineering), Sumitomo Metal Mining Company Ltd. (Sumitomo Metal Mining) and Primearth EV Energy Company Ltd. (PEVE) on October 27 announced the launch of the world&amp;#39;s first business to recycle nickel in used hybrid-vehicle nickel-metal-hydride batteries for use in new nickel-metal-hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Previously, nickel-metal-hydride batteries recovered by car dealers and vehicle dismantling businesses were subjected to reduction treatment, and scrap containing nickel was recycled as a raw material for stainless-steel manufacturing. &amp;nbsp;Now, with the development of high-precision nickel sorting and extraction technology, materials can be introduced directly into the nickel-refining process, thus achieving &amp;quot;battery-to-battery&amp;quot; recycling.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To carry out the business, TMC has established the Toyota HV Call Center to help recover the batteries, constructed advanced recycling facilities designed for mass production in cooperation with Toyota Chemical Engineering, and is receiving support from Sumitomo Metal Mining concerning the refining of nickel for use in batteries. &amp;nbsp;TMC is also receiving support from PEVE concerning quality assurance in the manufacture of hybrid-vehicle nickel-metal-hydride batteries.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In addition, making use of trucks on return trips from parts deliveries is planned to reduce environmental impact, including CO&lt;span class="small"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; emissions during transport.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The establishment of this recycling system in Japan will accelerate the creation of a sustainable, recycling-based society, a priority measure for TMC, and is a showcase for recovery and recycling technologies as effective means of promoting and reinforcing recycling in response to global resource limitations.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	TMC is currently investigating introducing this recycling system overseas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Battery Resource Recycling Flow&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A: Recovery and transport&lt;br /&gt;
	B: Reduction and sorting process (Toyota Chemical Engineering)&lt;br /&gt;
	C: Nickel refining process (Sumitomo Metal Mining)&lt;br /&gt;
	D: Battery manufacturing (PEVE)&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Molson Coors recognized as leader in environmental stewardship</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Molson Coors Brewing Company has been recognized in two recent reports for its sustainability efforts and environmental transparency. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 2010 S&amp;amp;P 500 report recognizes global companies making an effort to tackle climate change. In the report, Molson Coors was included in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index, which is a key component of CDP&amp;rsquo;s annual S&amp;amp;P 500 Report, highlighting the companies within the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index that have displayed the most professional approach to corporate governance in respect of climate change disclosure practices. Molson Coors is the only global brewer to be recognized in the family of Carbon Disclosure Leadership Indices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index recognizes companies that demonstrate good internal data management practices for understanding greenhouse gas emissions, including energy use,&amp;rdquo; said Paul Dickinson, chief executive of the Carbon Disclosure Project. &amp;ldquo;Companies that make this index have also demonstrated clear consideration of how climate change is and will impact their business. As companies&amp;rsquo; understanding of climate change issues grows, they are better placed to take positive action to manage and mitigate its risks.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition to the CDP report, Newsweek released its 2010 Green Rankings and Molson Coors was ranked in the top 10 in the food and beverage sector at number seven and 160 overall out of the U.S. Top 500 companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;At Molson Coors, we wholeheartedly support the efforts of both CDP and Newsweek to measure and report on companies&amp;rsquo; commitment to responsible environmental practices including carbon disclosure and sustainability. As a company whose products depend on the environment, Molson Coors has a vested interest in preserving and protecting our global resources,&amp;rdquo; said Bart Alexander, vice president, global alcohol policy and corporate responsibility for Molson Coors. &amp;ldquo;While we appreciate the recognition from the Carbon Disclosure Project and Newsweek, we know that we have a lot more to do and will continue to further improve on our practices and overall environmental stewardship.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index, compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of CDP, provides an evaluation tool for institutional investors. In 2010, it comprises 53 constituents of the S&amp;amp;P 500 Index based on analysis of the responses to CDP&amp;rsquo;s 2010 questionnaire which focused on greenhouse gas emissions, emissions reduction targets and risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Companies are scored on their climate change disclosure and high scores indicate good internal data management and understanding of climate change related issues affecting the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Newsweek ranking, the Green Score, is based on three components:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Environmental impact score: a comprehensive and standardized quantitative performance measurement that captures the total cost of all environmental impacts of a corporation&amp;rsquo;s global operations.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Green policies score: an analytical assessment of a company&amp;rsquo;s environmental policies and performance.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Reputation score: based on an opinion survey of corporate social responsibility professionals, academics and other environmental experts who subscribe to CorporateRegister.com as well as CEOs and high ranking officials in all companies on the Newsweek 500 list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

            <title>2011 Green Car of the Year finalists revealed</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Green Car Journal announced October 21 its five finalists for the 2011 Green Car of the Year, including the 2011 Chevrolet Volt, 2011 Ford Fiesta, 2011 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, 2011 Lincoln MKZ Hybrid and the 2011 Nissan LEAF. For the sixth consecutive year, this increasingly important award will be announced during a press conference at the LA Auto Show Press Days on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Green Car of the Year award is a program that honors environmental leadership in the automobile field and recognizes vehicles that become available to consumers during the award year. For the first time, the Green Car of the Year finalists include two primarily electric-drive vehicles in addition to two hybrids and a high mile-per-gallon, gasoline internal combustion engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;These five 2011 Green Car of the Year finalists reflect an auto industry in transition,&amp;quot; said Ron Cogan, editor and publisher of Green Car Journal and editor of &lt;a href="http://www.greencar.com/"&gt;GreenCar.com&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;quot;It wasn&amp;#39;t long ago when electric drive was a novelty. Now, it&amp;#39;s expected that auto manufacturers will include electric drive in some form among their model offerings.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While four of the five Green Car of the Year nominees do incorporate electric drive, the Ford Fiesta nominee underscores that internal combustion continues to evolve in important ways. This hatchback achieves up to 40 EPA estimated highway fuel economy, running on conventional gasoline. Along with vehicles incorporating electric drive, a new generation of internal combustion gasoline and clean diesel models are expected to push efficiencies ever higher in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Dozens of potential nominees weighed in during the selection process. Green Car Journal editors considered vehicles employing all fuels and technologies in the effort to raise the bar in environmental performance, including high efficiency gasoline internal combustion, advanced diesel, hybrids, electrics and vehicles capable of running on alternative fuels.

            <title>GE scientists employ jet engine cooling technology in prototype LED bulb</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Scientists from GE Global Research, the technology development arm for the General Electric Company, GE Lighting, and the University of Maryland &amp;mdash; as part of a two-year solid-state lighting program with the U.S. Department of Energy &amp;mdash; have announced the successful demonstration of a 1,500-lumen LED bulb (a standard 100-watt halogen PAR38 bulb produces 1,500 lumens) that addresses key barriers to more widespread adoption of LED bulbs for general lighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The prototype provides a snapshot of the future: &amp;ldquo;The scientists and technology leaders involved in this collaboration are dissolving some major barriers to the commercialization of general lighting LED bulbs,&amp;rdquo; says John Strainic, global product general manager for GE Lighting. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re taking swings at issues such as higher light output options, thermal management, and bulb size and weight. This kicks open the door to the solid-state age that is upon us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This &lt;a _extended="true" class="bhv_external" href="http://www.gelighting.com/na/business_lighting/products/led/apples_oranges_main.htm"&gt;LED technology&lt;/a&gt; achievement was announced today during a future of lighting symposium that GE hosted at its Global Research headquarters in Niskayuna, N.Y.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As part of the DOE project, GE and the research team of Professors Bongtae Han and Avram Bar-Cohen at the University of Maryland&amp;#39;s A. James Clark School of Engineering have developed and demonstrated novel cooling technologies that effectively manage the heat and promote lower system costs by reducing the number of LED chips required, when compared to conventional cooling technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mehmet Arik, a mechanical engineer at GE Global Research and principal investigator on the LED project, says, &amp;ldquo;This is a revolutionary cooling technology with great promise. It has the potential to help us take LED lighting performance and efficiency to new heights. Through further research and improvements, we may be able to increase performance without compromising the efficiency or lifetime of an LED bulb.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Aviation and Energy roots&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	GE&amp;rsquo;s cooling solution is based on technology the company now uses in its Aviation and Energy businesses. GE Global Research has a world-class team of fluidics experts who specialize in technologies that manage flow. They are developing innovative ways to control airflow and combustion to dramatically reduce the amount of pressure losses and loading characteristics in aircraft engines and power generation in gas and wind turbines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Arik adds, &amp;ldquo;Just one floor down in the same research building, I have colleagues using our dual cool jets technology to improve both the power and efficiency of GE&amp;rsquo;s jet engines and power generation turbines. With wind turbines, for example, we&amp;rsquo;re manipulating airflow to increase wind energy production. With LEDs, we&amp;rsquo;re using dual cool jets to improve the heat transfer rate and reduce the number of chips in the lamp.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;How GE&amp;rsquo;s dual cool jets technology works&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	GE dual cool jets are very small micro-fluidic bellows type devices that provide high-velocity jets of air, which impinge on the LED heat sink. These jets of air increase the heat transfer rate to more than ten times that of natural convection. The improved cooling enables LED operation at high drive currents without losses in efficiency or lifetime. For a given lumen output, the dual cool jets&amp;rsquo; improved thermal management reduces the necessary LED chip count. This, in turn, can dramatically lower the cost of the lamp. In addition to performance and cost advantages, this cooling technology enables reductions in LED lamp size and weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GE and the University of Maryland are in the final stages of the DOE project. The organizations are now studying ways to improve the reliability and lifetime of LED lighting systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/-GIRl3qXGGk" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Raytheon heralded as one of America's green companies</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Raytheon Company has been ranked as the 75th greenest company in America in the second annual &lt;a href="http://greenrankings.newsweek.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Newsweek Green Rankings&lt;/a&gt;. The magazine evaluated the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The No. 75 ranking in 2010 represents a significant leap for Raytheon, which last year came in at No. 208. Raytheon also finished in the No. 3 spot within the Transportation and Aerospace sector, ahead of Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Boeing, and behind only United Technologies and UPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Green Rankings were derived from three categories: Environmental Impact, Green Policies and Reputation, which were weighted at 45 percent, 45 percent and 10 percent respectively. Hundreds of metrics were considered, including those measuring greenhouse gas emissions, energy and water usage and pollution performance. After researching its own environmental data, Newsweek allowed each company to review the data for accuracy and furnish any additional pertinent information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The improvement in Raytheon&amp;rsquo;s ranking is due in part to the company&amp;rsquo;s Raytheon Sustainability program, launched in 2009. The program seeks to find ways to protect our environment and conserve natural resources by engaging our employees, customers, suppliers and communities. It&amp;rsquo;s our commitment to future generations.

            <title>Nissan begins production of LEAF in Japan</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan Motor Company Ltd. has started production at its Oppama, Japan,&amp;nbsp;facility for the all-new 100 percent&amp;nbsp;electric, zero-emission Nissan LEAF, which is slated to go on sale in December in Japan and the United States, and from early 2011, in select markets in Europe. In November, the company will begin exports to the United States, followed by shipments to Europe in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;This is a significant milestone, not only for Nissan and the Renault-Nissan Alliance, but also for the entire automotive industry,&amp;quot; said Nissan president and CEO Carlos Ghosn at the Nissan LEAF offline ceremony. &amp;quot;Consumers are clear. They want sustainable and affordable mobility ... and the Alliance is leading the way with cars that deliver exactly that, with the reliability, excitement and performance that consumers demand. The high-quality, innovative Nissan LEAF will radically transform what consumers expect from automobile manufacturers worldwide.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF will be produced at the Oppama Plant along with popular gasoline models such as Nissan Juke and Nissan Cube. Part of the assembly line has been modified to mount battery modules at the stage of production where fuel tanks are traditionally installed, and motors and inverters are mounted at the point where engines are installed in gasoline-powered vehicles. Production quality and efficiency are assured by applying the Nissan Production Way (NPW) in every step of the assembly process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF&amp;#39;s lithium-ion battery modules are manufactured at the Automotive Energy Supply Corporation (AESC) operation in Zama, Japan, which is a joint-venture of Nissan Motor Company Ltd. and NEC Corporation. The battery module, which contains 4 battery cells, are assembled at Zama and then shipped to the Nissan Oppama facility, where 48 of them are assembled into the electric car&amp;#39;s battery pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hidetoshi Imazu, executive vice president of manufacturing, said, &amp;quot;Oppama will serve as the &amp;#39;Mother Plant&amp;#39; for the production of Nissan LEAF. We will use all of the know-how and learnings from Oppama to ensure the highest quality at all sites that manufacture Nissan EVs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sites for future production of Nissan EVs include Smyrna, Tennessee, in the United States and Sunderland, England, in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Oppama plant has an annual production capacity of 50,000 units. Nissan LEAF will start production at Smyrna in late 2012 and at Sunderland in early 2013. At full ramp up, Smyrna will have an annual production capacity of 150,000 units, and Sunderland will have a capacity of 50,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan LEAF is the first 100% electric, zero-emission vehicle to be produced for the Renault-Nissan Alliance. Nissan, together with its Alliance partner, Renault, aims to be a global leader in zero-emission mobility. To date, the Alliance has signed 80 partnerships for zero-emission mobility with governments, municipalities and companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/tFtrGKHe-28" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>GE examines real state of electric vehicles in a billion-car world</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	With the &lt;a href="http://blogs.motortrend.com/6719595/green/127-mpg-this-volt-story-must-be-told/index.html#ixzz12uUKK9q1" jquery1287668288811="8"&gt;Chevy Volt hitting the market soon&lt;/a&gt;, the buzz on electric vehicles (&amp;ldquo;EVs&amp;rdquo;) is reaching a media fever pitch. Environmental and energy blogs are understandably excited and the business press is kicking the tires to see if an EV world could really be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704654004575517891616896222.html?mod=wsj_share_twitter" jquery1287668288811="9"&gt;biggest hammer used against EVs&lt;/a&gt; is the argument over costs &amp;ndash; specifically, will it be prohibitively expensive to build the cars, charging stations, and make the power grid upgrades needed. But even the major criticisms have another side, and for every skeptic, there&amp;rsquo;s a pumped-up EV advocate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In their story, &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/anthony/2010/10/innovation_lessons_from_electr.html" jquery1287668288811="10"&gt;Innovation Lessons From Electric Cars&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;rdquo; the &lt;em&gt;Harvard Business Review&lt;/em&gt; asks, what do innovators do when no one &amp;ldquo;knows for sure what customers will do with an innovation because they haven&amp;rsquo;t seen it before? The quickest approach is to look at what customers currently do, or look at historical case studies that bear some similarity to your idea. This may provide a general sense of what might happen, but it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be taken too seriously. After all, the whole point of an innovation is to change something in a meaningful enough way to render past patterns meaningless.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="border-bottom: #cccccc 1px solid; border-left: #cccccc 1px solid; width: 500px; font-family: arial; margin-bottom: 10px; border-top: #cccccc 1px solid; margin-right: 16px; border-right: #cccccc 1px solid"&gt;

		&lt;tr sizcache="0" sizset="1"&gt;
			&lt;td sizcache="0" sizset="1" style="padding-bottom: 9px; padding-left: 9px; padding-right: 9px; font-size: 8pt; padding-top: 9px"&gt;
				&lt;img alt="" border="0" src="http://files.gereports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/volt.jpg" style="margin-bottom: 1em" /&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 8pt; font-weight: bold"&gt;Road rave:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href="http://blogs.motortrend.com/6719595/green/127-mpg-this-volt-story-must-be-told/index.html#ixzz12uUKK9q1" jquery1287668288811="11"&gt;MotorTrend&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt; took on EV critics in the media, writing: &amp;ldquo;Here&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m so geeked on the Chevy Volt and why you should be, too. In normal, everyday driving we got 127 miles per gallon (fine, 126.7 mpg). Which is pretty amazing. Broken down, over the course of 299 miles on Los Angeles highways, byways and freeways, the Volt burned 2.36 gallons of gasoline (fine, 2.359 gallons &amp;mdash; we rounded up). Most other cars use up a tank of gas going 299 miles. The Volt, to reiterate, used 2.36 gallons over 299 miles. That&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;freaking&lt;/em&gt; amazing!&amp;rdquo; Photo: GM.&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Likewise, the &lt;a href="http://venturebeat.com/2010/10/19/two-things-about-electric-cars-the-wall-street-journal-missed/" jquery1287668288811="12"&gt;blog VentureBeat.com points out that critics&lt;/a&gt; who say the EV market will be very small &amp;mdash; despite about 20 models being introduced by a range of carmakers &amp;mdash; are missing how big the numbers are. Most industry analysts expect pure EVs to represent about 2 percent of global production by 2020 &amp;mdash; which will be a substantial number as the world is expected to have 1 billion cars on the road: &amp;ldquo;Even 1 percent of the global market in 2020 might represent 1 million electric cars. And, in that same year, those same analysts expect &lt;a href="http://sportscarmonitor.com/category/hybrid,new" jquery1287668288811="13"&gt;hybrids&lt;/a&gt; to be more than 10 percent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As to the argument that consumers won&amp;rsquo;t buy EVs because of &amp;ldquo;range anxiety&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash; the fear that an EV will run out of batteries and leave them stranded &amp;mdash; VentureBeat points out that &amp;ldquo;the average U.S household has more than 2 cars, and no one will make all three battery electrics with limited range. There will likely always be one car with gasoline power for long trips or emergencies. Day to day, families will plan around an EV&amp;rsquo;s range just as they now plan around their cars&amp;rsquo; carrying capacity and number of seats.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And as HBR added about the skeptical headlines of late: &amp;ldquo;Many great innovators had serious doubts cast on their ultimately successful ideas.&amp;rdquo; Thomas Edison might surely have a d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu moment if he were here today.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>GE to invest $432 million on green refrigerators</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	GE announced October 18 that it plans to invest $432 million to establish four U.S.-based refrigeration design and manufacturing centers of excellence and create 500 new &amp;quot;green&amp;quot; jobs by 2014, bringing the company&amp;#39;s total U.S. investment announced since 2009 to more than $1 billion and jobs created to 1,300.

            <title>Honda issues 2010 North American Environmental Report</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Honda released its sixth annual report on the company&amp;#39;s environmental footprint in North America, and efforts being made to minimize the environmental impact of Honda&amp;#39;s operations in the region. The report also includes a detailed review of the various technology approaches that Honda is taking in its efforts to address the issue of global climate change, perhaps the most serious and far-reaching environmental issue facing society today. The 2010 North American Environmental Report, published in electronic format only, can be &lt;a href="http://corporate.honda.com/environment/2010-report/"&gt;viewed and downloaded here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Despite the severe business conditions of the past year, Honda remains strongly committed to innovation and to the continued development of new products and technologies that minimize our environmental footprint and that help address society&amp;#39;s most pressing environmental concerns,&amp;quot; said Tetsuo Iwamura, chief operating officer of Honda&amp;#39;s North American Regional Operation. &amp;quot;Thanks to the efforts of Honda associates at all levels and in all areas of our operations, we continue to make significant progress in improving energy efficiency, reducing waste, and eliminating potentially harmful substances from our products, production operations and sales activities in North America. &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Highlights of the 2010 report include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		American Honda&amp;#39;s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) for model year 2009 (MY2009) rose 1 mpg to 31.3 mpg, a 3.3 percent increase from MY2008 and a 7.2 percent rise from MY2005, outpacing the company&amp;#39;s voluntary goal (set in May 2006) to achieve a 5 percent increase over MY2005 CAFE levels by MY2010.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Waste to landfills from manufacturing activity was reduced 87 percent from the FY2001 baseline and 65 percent from the previous fiscal year, with eight North American plants achieving zero waste to landfill, as Honda moved closer to its goal of achieving zero waste to landfill for all 14 of its plants in the region by April 1, 2011.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Total energy used in manufacturing was reduced 8 percent from the previous fiscal year, while energy use per automobile produced rose 2.4 percent as a result of lower production volumes.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Average CO2 emissions per automobile produced rose only 1 percent despite an 8 percent decrease in the volume of automobile production.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		&amp;quot;Intelligent&amp;quot; paint booth technology was implemented on all automobile paint lines in North America, reducing energy used in auto body painting by as much as 25 percent.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Emissions of volatile organic compounds from auto body painting were reduced 9.8 percent from FY2008 levels to 13.8 grams per square meter, exceeding Honda&amp;#39;s target of 20 grams per square meter.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Two new on-site parts consolidation centers &amp;ndash; at the Marysville, Ohio, auto plant and Timmonsville, S.C., all-terrain vehicle (ATV) plant &amp;ndash; are estimated to reduce CO2 emissions from supplier parts shipments by nearly 1,300 metric tons annually.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Honda&amp;#39;s North American Purchasing Division launched a Supply Chain Sustainability Initiative to promote actions aimed at reducing CO2 emissions from supplier activity.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		A new port facility in Richmond, Calif., Honda&amp;#39;s third west coast port facility, is expected to reduce truck travel by 2.7 million miles annually, cutting CO2 emissions from product distribution by an estimated 4,500 metric tons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 2010 North American Environmental Report covers the company&amp;#39;s operations during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2010 (FY2010) and utilizes a life cycle assessment (LCA) model to report on the environmental impact of Honda&amp;#39;s R&amp;amp;D, manufacturing and sales activities in the North America region, encompassing the United States, Canada and Mexico. The report looks at the environmental performance of the company&amp;#39;s automobile, powersports, and power equipment products, its 14 major manufacturing plants operating in North America in FY2010, and the corporate activities of 15 Honda group companies in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/nJOe2QVTqmo" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Portland cement plant to pay $350,000 to settle Clean Air Act violations</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the US Environmental Protection Agency, lodged a consent decree resolving Clean Air Act claims against CalPortland Company with respect to the company&amp;rsquo;s Rillito, Ariz., portland cement plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The settlement will resolve claims that CalPortland did not obtain permits required by the Clean Air Act.&amp;nbsp;As a result, CalPortland will either upgrade equipment, such as baghouses and spraybars to reduce particle pollution, or install a new, state-of-the-art kiln and retire four existing kilns. &amp;nbsp;In addition, the cement manufacturer must pay a $350,000 civil penalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;This settlement will result in cleaner air for communities affected by the CalPortland facility,&amp;rdquo; said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA&amp;rsquo;s Air Division for the Pacific Southwest region. &amp;ldquo;To safeguard the public health, all cement plants need to be properly permitted and keep their air emissions within the limits set by federal law.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Cement kiln operations emit particulate matter, which can cause major health problems.&amp;nbsp;Concerns for human health from exposure to coarse particle pollution include: effects on breathing and respiratory systems, damage to lung tissue, cancer, and premature death. The elderly, children, and people with chronic lung disease, influenza, or asthma, are especially sensitive to the effects of particulate matter.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period.&amp;nbsp;To view the consent decree or to submit comments, visit: &lt;a href="http://www.justice.gov/enrd/4759.htm"&gt;http://www.justice.gov/enrd/4759.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Ford, Dominion Virginia Power team to prepare state for electric vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Ford Motor Company and Dominion Virginia Power on October 18 announced they are coordinating efforts to help prepare Virginia for the operation of electric vehicles. Ford and Dominion will work together to develop consumer outreach and education programs on electric vehicles as well as share information on charging needs and requirements to ensure the electrical grid can support the necessary demand. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Over the next two years, Ford plans on bringing five new electrified vehicles to market including the Transit Connect Electric later this year and the Focus battery electric in late 2011,&amp;rdquo; said Nancy Gioia, global director of Electrification, Ford Motor Company. &amp;ldquo;We know there is an incredible excitement for electric vehicles in Virginia and across the country. To support the rollout and acceptance of these vehicles, it is crucial to work with local utilities, like Dominion, to make sure the necessary infrastructure is ready.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Cooperation between Ford and Dominion also involves working with the state and local governments on the most efficient ways to bring EVs to the state of Virginia. Government support for infrastructure and an easy charging station permitting process are considered to be two key elements to electric vehicle acceptance in Virginia and across the country.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Dominion Virginia Power is committed to ensuring electric vehicles flourish in the state of Virginia,&amp;rdquo; said Ken Barker, vice president, Customer Solutions &amp;amp; Energy Conservation, Dominion.&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;Our reliable electric system, along with responsible rates, will be key factors in the growth and adoption of electric vehicles among our customers.&amp;nbsp;Electric vehicles will be an exciting part of our future at Dominion Virginia Power and we are ready for it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	The collaboration between Ford and Dominion was announced during Ford&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Charging into the Future Electric Vehicle Tour.&amp;rdquo; The 14-city tour, which kicked off at Portland State University in Portland, Ore., in August, promotes Ford&amp;rsquo;s electric vehicle strategy and educates consumers about what to expect from electrified automobiles and what is needed from the public and private sector to support this new technology.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Over the next two years, Ford will introduce five electrified vehicles. Later this year, Ford and its partner Azure Dynamics will introduce the Transit Connect Electric small commercial van.&amp;nbsp;The Ford Focus Electric passenger car will be available in late 2011, followed by introductions of two third generation lithium-ion battery hybrids and a plug-in hybrid in 2012.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	These vehicles will achieve breakthrough efficiency; some, like the pure battery electric vehicles Ford Transit Connect Electric and Focus Electric, will use no gasoline at all.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	Electrification is an important piece of Ford&amp;rsquo;s overall product sustainability strategy that includes a range of fuel-efficient and alternative-fuel technologies such as EcoBoost&lt;sup&gt;&amp;trade;&lt;/sup&gt; engines, six-speed transmissions, power-assisted steering, aerodynamic improvements and light-weighting materials. Ford&amp;rsquo;s electrification strategy also leverages the most fuel-efficient powertrains, the most technically competent hybrids and global vehicle platforms to develop affordable choices for consumers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/msyNiPeFGqQ" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>Toyota to use  'Ecological Plastic' in vehicle interiors</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announces it plans to make vehicle liner material and other interior surfaces from a new &amp;quot;Ecological Plastic&amp;quot; that features the world&amp;#39;s first use of bio-PET. Starting with the luggage-compartment liner in the Lexus &amp;quot;CT200h&amp;quot; due at the beginning of 2011, TMC plans to increase both the number of vehicle series featuring the new material, as well as the amount of vehicle-interior area covered by it, and intends to introduce a vehicle model in 2011 in which Ecological Plastic will cover 80 percent of the vehicle interior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The epoch-making bio-PET-based Ecological Plastic &amp;ndash; developed with Toyota Tsusho Corporation &amp;ndash; is characterized by: 1) enhanced performance (heat-resistance, durability performance, shrink resistance) compared to conventional bio-plastics and performance parity with petroleum-based PET, 2) the potential to approach the cost-per-part performance of petroleum-based plastics through volume production and 3) usability in seats and carpeting and other interior components that require a high level of performance unattainable by hitherto Ecological Plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ecological Plastic has the benefit of being more carbon neutral than conventional petroleum-based plastics, meaning it can lessen product-life-cycle CO2 emissions; use of it can contribute to a reduction in the use of limited petroleum resources. TMC has been engaged in applying Ecological Plastics to automobiles since 2000, and, in May 2003, became the first in the world to use in a mass-production vehicle a bio-plastic made from polyactic acid, which was introduced in the spare tire cover and floor mats of the Japanese-market &amp;quot;Raum&amp;quot; small car. TMC has since expanded its use of Ecological Plastic, achieving the world&amp;#39;s highest level3 of use of bio-plastics in a vehicle by using it to cover 60 percent of the exposed surfaces of interior parts in the &amp;quot;Sai&amp;quot; hybrid sedan launched in December 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

            <title>How 'green' is your energy consumption?</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Environmental responsibility is becoming more than just not discharging pollutants into the nearby stream or emitting toxic materials into the atmosphere. Many companies are making the decision to &amp;ldquo;go green&amp;rdquo; to show their customers, shareholders and employees that they care about the environment; and as an equal incentive, they look to lower energy consumption, increase equipment reliability and cause a positive change to the profit and loss statement. As the leadership of an organization begins to look for potential areas to make investments to achieve these goals, they often look at their production processes to find these opportunities. Many times, the areas of the business that provide the greatest return are overlooked and investments are made in areas that don&amp;rsquo;t generate the energy savings expected.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The first area identified is often a program to increase motor efficiency. This is a good area for plants to look at carefully because more than half the electrical energy consumed in the United States is consumed by electric motors. Improving efficiency of the electric motors in your plant and the equipment they drive can reduce energy consumption and production costs. The annual cost of operating a motor is usually many times the initial purchase price. As electric motors are rebuilt, it is important to consider the energy efficiency of a rewound motor compared to purchasing a new energy-efficient motor. The new, more efficient motors have technological enhancements that allow them to operate more efficiently with less vibration, increased winding insulation, and, like the new automobiles of today, they use less energy to operate.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A second area of operation that is often overlooked and is a prime candidate to drive increased energy efficiency is the lubrication program. A study conducted by Lubrication Engineers Inc. indicated a typical result of companies that upgrade their lubricant and reliability practices is to experience a documented reduction in energy consumption of 5 to 15 percent. Gearboxes had the greatest decrease of 15 percent followed by air compressors at 12 percent reduction and electric motors at 4 percent reduction. A misconception many organizations have is &amp;ldquo;if it costs more, it must be better.&amp;rdquo; Price doesn&amp;rsquo;t guarantee the best result when it comes to a lubrication program. Sometimes a synthetic lubricant provides the most energy efficiency; other times, maybe a mineral oil would be the most efficient and effective lubricant. It is important to monitor and select the correct lubricant that provides energy efficiency, performance and equipment reliability or the program could be causing more problems than it is solving.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	According to a survey conducted by the United States Department of Energy (DOE), 70 percent of manufacturing plants have compressed air systems. According to that same survey, compressed air systems account for an average of 10 percent of electricity consumption in these plants. To further emphasize this point, energy consumption across the United States by manufacturing plants adds up to $1.5 billion annually to produce compressed air. These compressed air systems are one of the most costly consumers of energy in a plant, but are necessary to provide a valuable source of power for a variety of equipment from hand tools to production equipment. Programs to reduce compressed air losses (leaks) can produce 10 to 15 percent savings in energy costs on an annual basis, providing an excellent opportunity to reduce energy consumption.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Conducting a self analysis of current business practices in place today can also expose many areas of waste that consume excess energy. Storage practices for electric motors, gearboxes, pumps, electrical components and other items in the maintenance, repair and operation (MRO) inventory also can cause these units to consume excess energy when placed in service. When thinking outside the plant walls, it becomes clear that procurement practices can also have a negative impact on energy conservation. If the suppliers are required to make additional deliveries to the plant because of bad planning or a reactive maintenance environment, the cost for additional fuel adds to energy consumption. Environmental awareness has gone from thinking inside the four walls of the plant to removing the walls and looking at the effects our products, actions and energy consumption have on our communities and the environment we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

            <title>Michigan readies as U.S. prepares for electric vehicles</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	More than 5,300 home and workplace charging stations are planned to be installed in Michigan as the state prepares for the introduction of new electric vehicle technology. General Motors and its partners are teaming up to help give Chevrolet Volt buyers more options for charging their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DTE Energy pledges to install 2,500 240-volt home charging stations for plug-in vehicles, and Consumers Energy is matching that pledge. The utilities will cover up to $2,500 of the cost of the charging station and installation. GM&amp;#39;s Voltec 240 V home charging station is priced at just $490 plus an estimated $1,475 for installation. The city of Lansing Board of Water and Light will provide an additional 25 charging stations to its customers and by the end of 2011, General Motors plans to have almost 350 charging stations in place for employees at its facilities in Michigan, with more than 100 already installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In addition, more than 1,500 Chevrolet dealers across the U.S. plan to install charging stations for use by customers. This number includes nearly 650 dealers that will soon begin selling the Volt in retail launch markets and approximately 900 others across the country that are authorized to provide service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	More important than the total volume of charging stations is where they will be located, according to Tom Stephens, GM vice chairman, Global Product Operations. &amp;quot;Since our homes may soon be our fueling stations of the future we believe the most important way to make communities &amp;#39;plug-in ready&amp;#39; is by enabling residential charging.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of these stations will be placed in consumers&amp;#39; garages, carports and driveways. A few will be strategically located, such as the two GM placed in front of its headquarters at the Renaissance Center at the building&amp;#39;s entrance off of Jefferson Ave in Detroit. A total of 18 charging stations will be operational in and around the Renaissance Center within the next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We think this opens up doors for those Volt owners who want to charge at work or who don&amp;#39;t have a place at home to charge the car overnight. They&amp;#39;ll be able to drive electrically when they can, and they can drive on gasoline when they need to,&amp;quot; Stephens said in remarks at the Business of Plugging In Conference in Detroit on Tuesday. &amp;quot;We see these stations as an incentive to our employees to join the Electric Vehicle movement &amp;hellip; and as a demonstration to other businesses to encourage their own employees to drive greener.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM-installed charging stations for use by its employees in Michigan will include 34 at the Detroit-Hamtramck assembly center where the Volt is built and 140 in the homes of employees driving early-build models for quality evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Many of the stations at GM facilities will be powered by renewable solar energy. The Detroit-Hamtramck assembly center already has 10 stations in place powered by photovoltaic systems from SunLogics Inc. Envision Solar International will provide its innovative Solar Tree&amp;reg; with EnvisionTrak system for use at the Warren Technical Center and Milford Proving Ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	GM envisioned the need for public and workplace charging stations in 2007 when it formed a collaboration with DTE, Consumers Energy, the Electric Power Research Institute and more than 50 other utilities. Many of those utilities are or will be launching similar programs to help customers prepare for electrification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Michigan is one of nine regions in the United States identified by the U.S. Department of Energy to lead the electrification movement. Free home charging stations provided by ECOtality and Coulomb Technologies will be available to 4,400 eligible Volt owners through a program funded by the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve put a lot of thought into the best way to enhance the electric vehicle experience,&amp;quot; Stephens said. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve focused on everything from vehicle-to-grid technical interfaces, codes and standards to leading consumer education and outreach.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, the Society of Engineers-approved industry standard for charging equipment was led by a GM engineer. And GM&amp;#39;s Opel subsidiary recently announced a vehicle-to-grid experiment in Germany involving a battery electric version of the Opel Meriva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/ukMDHgpxCSE" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>

            <title>BMW introduces hydrogen fuel cell material handling equipment</title>
            <description>&lt;p&gt;
	BMW Manufacturing Company announced October 10 that it is implementing a new alternative fuel platform to use hydrogen fuel cells to power the plant&amp;rsquo;s material handling equipment. Hydrogen fuel cell-powered forklifts, tuggers and stackers will be used in BMW&amp;rsquo;s new assembly hall that produces the new BMW X3 Sports Activity Vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Fuel cells take stored chemical energy, such as hydrogen in this case, and convert it into electrical energy through two internal electrochemical reactions. The only by-products of hydrogen fuel cells are heat and water, making this energy choice more efficient than other more conventional energy sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;BMW has taken another important step to affirm our global commitment to sustainability with a project such as this in Spartanburg,&amp;rdquo; said Josef Kerscher, president of BMW Manufacturing. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a clear vision and determination to reach our goal of using renewable energy as much as possible throughout the plant site.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementation of this new technology has been done in concert with partners from Linde North America and Plug Power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Mike Beckman, vice president of Linde&amp;rsquo;s alternative energy team, said, &amp;ldquo;We have partnered with BMW to work toward our companies&amp;rsquo; shared goal of implementing cost-effective, alternative energy solutions that reduce emissions. BMW&amp;rsquo;s selection of Linde to supply the hydrogen and fueling system is testament to our significant capabilities, leading technologies and dedicated professionals who worked closely with BMW to implement the fueling solution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are proud BMW has selected to work with Plug Power as they continue to solidify their position as a leading sustainable automotive manufacturer,&amp;rdquo; said Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power Inc. &amp;ldquo;The proven productivity increases on the manufacturing floor through the use of GenDrive will give BMW a further competitive advantage in the global automotive marketplace.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Installation of a storage and distribution center within BMW&amp;rsquo;s existing Energy Center, an 11-megawatt facility, along with six on-site fueling stations were recently completed by BMW at their only North American manufacturing facility in South Carolina. The hydrogen used for this project was manufactured at the most sustainable source within Linde&amp;rsquo;s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Initially, the hydrogen-powered material handling fleet will consist of more than 85 pieces of equipment, making it one of the largest hydrogen fuel-cell fleets in the U.S. In addition to the many other benefits, fuel cells offer a much longer operating life than lead-acid batteries. Fuel cells provide continuous power with no loss of power as the tank nears empty as opposed to battery-powered equipment that run slower as the battery nears empty. These units, when full, run on a two-kilogram fuel tank and run for eight to 10 hours. Fuel cell units can be refueled by a driver in less than three minutes at an on-site hydrogen fueling station. On average, it takes about 20 minutes to refuel a depleted battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Since hydrogen is the only source of energy for the fuel cells being used in the new facility, BMW Manufacturing estimates that this project will avoid 1.8 million kilowatt hours per year of electricity consumption at the plant that would have been used to charge a battery-powered fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Hydrogen Fuel Cell fleet is the perfect complement to BMW&amp;rsquo;s successful Landfill Gas to Energy initiative started in early 2003. BMW powers approximately 50 percent of the plant&amp;rsquo;s total energy requirements using methane from a local landfill, a previously wasted resource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Implementation of the landfill gas program reduces CO2 emissions by 92,000 tons per year. To date, the landfill gas project has saved BMW an annual average of $5 million in energy costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;BMW Manufacturing Company&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	BMW Manufacturing Company is a subsidiary of BMW AG in Munich, Germany and is the global producer of the BMW X5 and X3 Sports Activity Vehicles and X6 Sports Activity Coupe. In addition to the South Carolina manufacturing facility, BMW North American subsidiaries include sales, marketing and financial services operations in the United States, Canada and throughout Latin America; and a design firm and technology office in California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/noria/reliableplant/tags/green_manufacturing/~4/vNrQ41h558Y" height="1" width="1" alt=""/&gt;</description>
