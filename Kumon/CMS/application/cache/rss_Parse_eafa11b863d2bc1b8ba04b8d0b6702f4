      <title>Trump Administration Scrubs Mentions of Climate and Renewables From White House Website</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/2j0BYNA-axw/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-administration-scrubbed-mentions-of-climate-change</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A change has come to Whitehouse.gov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Immediately after Donald Trump assumed the office of president Friday, the presidential URL changed. Where there once was "Energy," now there is "&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;An America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt;." And where there once was a climate action plan, now there is &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/energy/climate-change" target="_blank"&gt;no mention of it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The social cost of carbon -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/oira/social-cost-of-carbon" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;. The Clean Power Plan -- &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-record/climate" target="_blank"&gt;gone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The vestigial page titles still appear in a Google search, but the links lead nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	During and after the election, Trump had spoken derisively of federal efforts to combat climate change, but had also signaled a willingness to embrace renewables as a domestically produced energy source and jobs driver. After months of speculation about how Trump would act toward clean energy once in office, the administration has clearly signaled its intent to erase President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s clean energy policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Obama-era website lives on &lt;a href="http://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, so the content itself will not be lost. The scrubbing, though, indicates that the peaceful transition of power need not coincide with a continuity of facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Instead, the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/america-first-energy" target="_blank"&gt;America First Energy Plan&lt;/a&gt; lays out a new course: "President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule."&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Right there, as explicitly as it can be written: The Trump administration plans to kill Obama&amp;#39;s climate policies. And it starts with the website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A search within the site for the phrase "climate change" turns up one page, a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/1600/first-ladies/mamieeisenhower" target="_blank"&gt;biography of former First Lady Mamie Eisenhower&lt;/a&gt;. The article references the climate of San Antonio, as well as the word "changes" in a non-climatic context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The new plan also asserts the value of domestic energy production: "In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America&amp;rsquo;s national security interest." The policy lists the domestic energy sources that qualify:&amp;nbsp;shale, oil, natural gas and coal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean coal technology, which is only just beginning to prove itself at commercial scale, gets a shout-out. But renewables, which accounted for &lt;a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29492"&gt;the majority of new energy capacity&lt;/a&gt; added last year, don&amp;#39;t earn a mention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	While declaring a need to develop energy at home and cast off the nation&amp;#39;s dependence on oil cartel OPEC, the statement also makes an ominous reference to expansion abroad: "At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy." This presages a strategy of fossil-fuel exploration not just at home, but overseas, replacing Paris treaty climate commitments with help for new drilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even basic landing pages for White House organizational divisions have disappeared. Try searching for the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ceq" target="_blank"&gt;Council on Environmental Quality&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp" target="_blank"&gt;Office of Science and Technology Policy&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the landing page for Statements and Releases from the Press Office has gone blank, so a casual reader won&amp;#39;t stumble upon any mentions of the danger of climate change or the jobs created by the clean energy industry while scrolling back through the archives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/cleanpowerplan/clean-power-plan-existing-power-plants" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; of the Environmental Protection Agency, which crafted the CPP, had not been touched as of this writing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Clean energy industry groups are gearing up to pitch wind and solar as major job creators. They&amp;#39;ll have their work cut out for them to even gain recognition in the new president&amp;#39;s energy policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Massachusetts Decided to Set an Energy Storage Target. What Should It Be?</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/LReh1zNY4eA/massachusetts-energy-storage-target-how-big-should-it-be</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/massachusetts-energy-storage-target-how-big-should-it-be</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The Bay State could soon follow the Bay Area as a leading battery boomtown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/12-27-16-doer-letter-to-conferees-storage-target.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt;, at the close of 2016, that it would set an energy storage target. Now it has six months to figure out what that number should be and how to implement it, following the timeline set by &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/an-energy-storage-mandate-could-be-coming-soon-to-massachusetts"&gt;legislation&lt;/a&gt; last summer. Once complete, this will be only the third state-level target after California and Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;#39;s mandate gave it a decisive lead in attracting storage companies and deploying the technology in homes, businesses and on the grid. Massachusetts currently has very little storage deployed, but it is already home to a cluster of storage startups that spun off from research at MIT. With an effective target, Massachusetts could set itself up as the second hub of the U.S. storage industry, while streamlining the operation of its grid and the integration of new renewable generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Finding the right target, though, requires a careful balancing of competing goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"DOER should assure the target is large enough that substantial, relevant experience is gained by all, but not so large that it becomes unworkable and a substitute for the fully functioning market," wrote Phil Giudice, CEO and president of Cambridge-based storage company Ambri, in a letter to DOER Commissioner Judith Judson in December.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DOER isn&amp;#39;t starting from scratch here. The department had a hand in the &lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt; report from September, which comprehensively analyzed the value of storage for the Massachusetts grid and concluded that up to &lt;a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/why-the-new-massachusetts-energy-storage-report-is-such-a-big-deal"&gt;1,766 megawatts of storage installed by 2020&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;would maximize savings for ratepayers. Storage can reduce the state&amp;#39;s system costs like peak capacity, transmission and distribution upgrades, overall energy prices, integration of intermittent renewables, and ancillary grid services that smooth out the momentary differences between supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The authors included a humbler proposal -- namely, that 600 megawatts would be achievable given current market and regulatory realities, and still save ratepayers $800 million by 2025.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The state could go in a different direction after gathering stakeholder input this month. Questions remain about how exactly the target would be implemented, which will have a significant impact on what kind of real-world changes it drives. Given the uncertainty, GTM reached out to policy experts and storage industry professionals active in Massachusetts to hear what they hope the state decides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Keep it 600&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Based on current market design and state rules, 600 megawatts is a reasonable target, said &lt;a href="http://www.mass.gov/eea/docs/doer/state-of-charge-report.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; coauthor Jacqueline DeRosa, vice president of emerging technologies at Customized Energy Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The 1,766 megawatt number makes some assumptions that the world is a certain way," she said. It&amp;#39;s more of a best-case scenario, if storage deployment could proceed optimally without bureaucratic or regulatory obstacles. But, she added, "It&amp;rsquo;s not that easy to change the world overnight."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The 600 MW goal reflects the deployments the state could likely achieve in the near future. It was the outcome of collaborative discussions held by DOER with stakeholders like utilities, project developers and storage vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A common refrain among energy storage professionals interviewed for this story was that a higher number would be great, but 600 megawatts is a strong starting point. It would be a big step up from the approximately 2 megawatts of advanced storage capacity the state has now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With two and a half years from the adoption of the targets to their due date, the state may opt for a less ambitious number initially. It would be possible to hit 600 megawatts in that timeframe, though, said Ravi Manghani, energy storage director at GTM Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For others, like Ted Ko, director of policy at commercial storage company Stem, 600 megawatts is the minimum for attracting a bustling industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The state can and should go higher -- the industry has shown time and again that it is ready to respond quickly, at scale, when given a big enough market signal," he wrote in an email Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	What type is it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The energy storage industry is still young enough that just saying the words "storage mandate" gets folks fired up. The fact of the matter is, though, the number itself doesn&amp;#39;t mean very much in terms of what the deployment will look like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The category of energy storage includes systems that operate on a matter of minutes, or for half an hour, or a couple hours, or very many hours. Different jobs require different durations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"My biggest wish is that the storage be discussed in terms of its application, and therefore the type of technology that is best suited to meet that application," said Jonathan Milley, director of business development at Massachusetts-based battery maker Vionx. "If you need a hammer, don&amp;rsquo;t get a screwdriver."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Vionx is scaling its flow battery technology, and has one system operating in Massachusetts, one being commissioned and one under construction. Those three will add up to more than 1 megawatt of capacity at 6 hours duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s not surprising to hear a long-duration battery maker recommending a carve-out for long-duration batteries. Without that, cheap, short-duration lithium-ion batteries could swarm the mandate. Similarly, Ambri, which is commercializing a new liquid metal battery technology, recommended that part of the procurement target go to demonstrations of emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Company interests aside, there&amp;#39;s a strong argument to be made for connecting the storage mandate to particular services on the grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The &lt;em&gt;State of Charge&lt;/em&gt; report found the most lucrative savings from storage come from using it for peak capacity, which defers expensive gas peaker plant construction and lowers prices in capacity markets. If the state decides to prioritize storage taking over the role of peaking plants to save ratepayers lots of money, it could create a mandate with a certain percentage of capacity dedicated to longer-duration storage for peaking capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Conversely, if the state wants to ensure that storage can meet certain ancillary service needs in the near future, it could set a target for short duration batteries. DOER asked stakeholders to comment not just on the scale of the target, but the structure, so targeted goals such as these could end up in the final decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Further guidance could also address whether the storage goes in front of the meter, putting it in the realm of utilities, or behind the meter, under the purview of commercial and residential customers. Ko suggested one-third of the target should be set aside for behind the meter storage, to take advantage of private investment to spur deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California set a precedent in this regard, as it required its three investor-owned utilities to procure storage at the transmission, distribution and customer levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Who owns it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Who controls the storage asset says a lot about what it will look like, so some stakeholders are pushing for the target to address this as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If the target expects utilities to shoulder most of the burden, they could push for a lower target, because they&amp;#39;ve have to do all the work. Opening up ownership to a wider range of entities spreads out the responsibility, and diversifies the potential benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ko proposed that a minimum of 50 percent of storage installations should be for customer or third-party-owned systems. That would carve out some territory for Stem, which owns and operates storage systems on behalf of commercial customers, but it would create opportunities for other companies too.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"A primary purpose of any storage mandate is to enable all stakeholders to learn from a wide range of business models and see where the market wants to use and evolve the services," he said. "Last year&amp;rsquo;s energy bill gave the utilities permission to own storage, so if a minimum isn&amp;rsquo;t set, the mandate could be met with a handful of large projects used in a utility-owned business model."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If DOER chooses to prioritize storage as driver of business learning, it could even consider a carve-out for storage designed or built in-state, although out-of-state battery companies would have something to say about that.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	Learn from the West&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Massachusetts benefits from the chance to watch a storage mandate unfold in California over the last couple years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"California has absolutely led, they broke open the market, they really put a shock to the utility system and said the world is going to be different," said Matt Roberts, executive director of the Energy Storage Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One highlight: launching a mandatory storage deployment did not explode the grid. The utilities are chugging along toward the 1.3-gigawatt goal and do not appear to be suffering from overexertion. In the meantime, the policy nourished a once-tiny industry and turned it into a considerably larger one.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The grid benefited too. When the enormous natural-gas leak transpired at Aliso Canyon, the Southern Calif. utilities fast-tracked storage deployment to keep meeting local capacity needs in the absence of all that fossil fuel. The storage industry, buoyed by previous deployments, responded with cheaper-than-ever bids and rapid deployment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That said, Massachusetts has differed from California in its approach to forming the policy. The eastern state has prioritized stakeholder buy-in throughout the process as a means to collaboratively form the target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"In California, it was a little more of a top-down, &amp;#39;Go procure this stuff&amp;#39; type of approach," Roberts said. "Massachusetts is a little more bottom-up, a little more, &amp;#39;Let&amp;#39;s get together and everyone show their math.&amp;#39;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If a utility wants a certain target, it has to explain why. Meanwhile, storage companies have a chance to justify their dream targets. The final product will be some kind of synthesis of many voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	California&amp;#39;s mandate benefited from a strong collaboration between the California Public Utilities Commission and grid operator CAISO, which allowed storage to play more of a role at the wholesale market level. That kind of working relationship isn&amp;#39;t guaranteed between Massachusetts and ISO New England, Manghani noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"California had the luxury of an ISO that has jurisdiction in a single state," he said. "ISO New England has to work across multiple New England states. That could cause some friction.&amp;nbsp;Without the successful and wholehearted participation of ISO New England, the mandate would lose some of its effectiveness."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are plenty of rules and policies under Massachusetts&amp;#39; control on which the state can act quickly, like adding storage as a qualified technology under the Alternative Portfolio Standard. To unlock the full potential value of storage, though, the ISO would need to change certain rules governing the wholesale electricity markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In a world with a more developed storage industry, Massachusetts has more options to choose from in crafting a target that best serves its own goals and desires. The choices made there in the coming months will model a path forward for the next state to take this plunge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>First Solar Proves That PV Plants Can Rival Frequency Response Services From Natural Gas Peakers</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/P5jN243Ne8g/PV-Plants-Can-Rival-Frequency-Response-Services-From-Natural-Gas-Peakers</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/PV-Plants-Can-Rival-Frequency-Response-Services-From-Natural-Gas-Peakers</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Last summer, First Solar and California grid operator CAISO ran a set of tests to show that utility-scale solar PV, instead of being a disruptive influence on the power grid, could actually help stabilize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Over a series of days in August, First Solar slightly curtailed power output at a 300-megawatt solar farm in California, enabled its array of inverters, and plugged into CAISO&amp;rsquo;s system. It then orchestrated the plant&amp;rsquo;s output to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s automatic generation control (AGC) signals, respond to its frequency regulation commands, and use inverters for voltage regulation, power factor regulation and reactive power control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The results, according to &lt;a href="http://www.caiso.com/Documents/UsingRenewablesToOperateLowCarbonGrid-FAQ.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; released last week, showed that First Solar was able to meet, and sometimes exceed, the frequency regulation response usually provided by natural-gas-fired peaker plants. First Solar was also able to provide inverter-based services throughout the day -- and possibly even at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It turned in a respectable performance matching CAISO&amp;rsquo;s wholesale market price signals -- even when clouds appeared on the afternoon of the second day of testing, reducing First Solar&amp;rsquo;s capacity to shift its load.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All told, the data from CAISO, First Solar and the Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) indicates that a utility-scale solar farm, equipped with standard inverters and software controls, can serve to smooth out grid fluctuations from the solar itself or from other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And for California, a state with 9,000 megawatts of &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/8minutenergy-Boasts-the-First-Solar-PPA-to-Beat-Fossil-Fuel-Prices-in-Calif"&gt;transmission-connected solar&lt;/a&gt; and plans for 20,000 megawatts more by 2030, that could be a valuable resource. &amp;ldquo;If PV-generated power can offer a supportive product that benefits the power system and is economic for PV power plant owners and customers, this functionality should be recognized and encouraged,&amp;rdquo; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Utility-scale solar PV is already causing California some grid challenges, in the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-california-duck-curve-is-real-and-bigger-than-expected"&gt;form of the duck curve&lt;/a&gt; -- a deep midday drop in net load driven by lots of solar flooding onto the grid, and a steep ramp-up starting in the late afternoon that extends into evening as solar fades away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO is also experiencing &amp;ldquo;periods of oversupply conditions, especially pronounced during weekends when electricity demand is low and renewable production is high.&amp;rdquo; Currently, when faced with potentially destabilizing conditions like this, CAISO has no choice but to curtail renewable power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Significant levels of renewables curtailment took place during certain days of the spring of 2016,&amp;rdquo; the report noted, including one day in late April when more than 2,000 megawatts of renewable generation had to be taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_Curtailment_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 370px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Given the alternative of curtailment, operators of utility-scale solar may find it advantageous to curtail power slightly in advance, in order to provide "headroom" to move up and down to meet grid needs. That&amp;#39;s what First Solar did on two days in August, and the data shows that it was able to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s AGC signal and provide &amp;ldquo;fast and accurate AGC performance&amp;hellip;at different solar resource conditions.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_AGCchart_midday_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 292px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The only blips came in the afternoon, when clouds passed over the plant, reducing First Solar&amp;rsquo;s output and shrinking the headroom needed to maneuver. &amp;ldquo;However, even during these periods the plant was demonstrating good AGC performance by closely following the commanded set point,&amp;rdquo; according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_AGCchart_clouds_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 289px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Where PV and inverters really shine, however, is in frequency regulation, with inverters that can respond much more quickly than spinning generators. &amp;ldquo;The plant demonstrated fast and accurate frequency-response performance for different droop settings (3% and 5%) under various solar resource conditions for both under and over-frequency events,&amp;rdquo; the report found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO has been &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/In-California-Solar-and-Wind-Boosts-the-Price-for-Frequency-Regulation"&gt;increasing its payouts for frequency regulation&lt;/a&gt; over the past year, in part to manage the grid instabilities that come with an increasing share of intermittent wind and solar power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/CAISO_RegChart_XL.png" style="width: 600px; height: 336px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, looking at the test data, &amp;ldquo;a conclusion can be made that regulation accuracy by PV plant is about 24-30 points better than fast gas turbine technologies.&amp;rdquo; CAISO is working on implementing national rules that require grid operators to reward fast-responding frequency regulation assets, such as grid-tied batteries, electric vehicles, fast demand response, or, in this case, solar farm inverters, and &amp;ldquo;data from these tests will be used by the CAISO in future ancillary service market design,&amp;rdquo; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the PV control capabilities used by First Solar and CAISO are technically feasible today and &amp;ldquo;a few areas throughout the world have already started to request or require PV power plants to provide some of them,&amp;rdquo; the report said. One example is Hawaii, with utility-integrated projects like the ones that &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/aes-puts-energy-heavy-battery-behind-new-kauai-solar-peaker"&gt;SolarCity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/aes-puts-energy-heavy-battery-behind-new-kauai-solar-peaker"&gt;AES Energy Storage&lt;/a&gt; are building on the island of Kauai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"In the United States, utility-scale PV plants are rarely recognized as having these capabilities and typically are not used by utilities or system operators for electrical grid services.&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s largely because the economic and regulatory models for rewarding it aren&amp;rsquo;t in place yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s important, because the kinds of tasks First Solar performed last summer required it to curtail overall output, to offer some &amp;ldquo;headroom&amp;rdquo; to make changes according to CAISO&amp;rsquo;s commands. For example, it curtailed output by 30 megawatts, or about 10 percent, to give it maneuverability to follow CAISO&amp;rsquo;s AGC signal -- although &amp;nbsp;the report noted that &amp;ldquo;relatively small and short-term energy storage&amp;rdquo; could help mitigate cloud impact and other uncertainties in that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are examples of utilities rewarding solar and wind power for curtailing their power based on AGC signals. The Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCO), for example, can use wind reserves, which sometimes make up 60 percent of generation in its system, as an ancillary service for frequency regulation, the report noted. &amp;ldquo;Similar services can be provided by curtailed PV power plants in California; however, regulatory, market, and operational issues need to be resolved for this to become possible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	First Solar also had to curtail output to provide frequency regulation, although just how much it would need to curtail would depend on what its service might be worth in CAISO&amp;rsquo;s coming market redesign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CAISO, NREL and First Solar are planning to explore the &amp;ldquo;economic and/or contractual incentives to maximize production and not hold back production to provide reliability services&amp;rdquo; as one of the next steps in the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

      <title>Australian Energy Roadmap: A Zero-Carbon Grid Is Possible by 2050, With Consumers at the Center</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/AK1Gp864um0/A-Zero-Carbon-Grid-Is-Possible-by-2050-in-Australia</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/A-Zero-Carbon-Grid-Is-Possible-by-2050-in-Australia</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Last month, an authoritative report found that radically decarbonizing Australia&amp;#39;s energy system could be achieved by 2050 -- all without negative impacts on the economy, and with big savings for both consumers and utilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The report was produced by the&amp;nbsp;Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (&lt;a href="http://www.csiro.au/en/About"&gt;CSIRO&lt;/a&gt;) and Energy Networks Australia (&lt;a href="http://www.energynetworks.com.au/about-us"&gt;ENA&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CSIRO is a corporate entity of the Australian government and widely regarded as the leading scientific authority in the land. ENA represents all gas distribution and electricity transmission and distribution businesses throughout Australia. Together they drew on the findings of 19 existing reports to paint a vision for the country&amp;rsquo;s power sector that counters mainstream thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://energynetworksassociation.cmail19.com/t/i-l-ultkzy-ktehkiki-r/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electricity Network Transformation Roadmap&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a renewables-only&amp;nbsp;Australia could save AUD $16 billion (USD $12 billion) in infrastructure costs by 2050, and slash average household bills by AUD $414 every year, a reduction of around 30 percent on current charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Customers will do a lot of the heavy lifting, providing a vast amount of distributed energy resource services -- a service which should be paid for by networks to the tune of AUD $2.5 billion annually by 2050, according to the report authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As Garth Crawford, acting CEO for ENA, explained: &amp;ldquo;Our roadmap analysis predicts that by 2050 customers -- not utilities -- will have determined over AUD $200 billion in power-system expenditure. The transformation of the energy sector that we have seen and will continue to see over the next decade is driven by customers as they embrace new technologies, take control of their energy use and support action on climate change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, Crawford and his colleagues estimate that &amp;ldquo;millions of customer-owned generators will supply 30 percent to 50 percent of Australia&amp;rsquo;s electricity needs&amp;rdquo; by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Effectively, the distribution network would be paying households and businesses for power supplied by rooftop solar-plus-storage, and thus avoid some of the costs of poles and wires, translating into overall savings for all.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For this to happen, says Crawford, rooftop PV capacity would have to quadruple by 2027 to 29 gigawatts, and more than double again, to hit 72 gigawatts by 2050.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In order to make the best use of all this capacity, storage will have to keep pace too. Estimates from the roadmap forecast 34 gigawatt-hours by 2027, rising to 87 gigawatt-hours by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Australia already has the highest penetration of rooftop solar in the world. The domestic storage market is also surging, with prices for both falling more rapidly than originally forecast.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Storage would have a big part to play at the grid scale, too, according to the roadmap. However, the researchers keep their options open about what type of storage will dominate in the emerging technological mix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Battery storage is forecast to play a key role in energy balancing and grid security as centralized renewable generation increases. However, a diversity of potential solutions could also be employed cost-effectively as alternatives while still achieving a zero net emission target by 2050,&amp;rdquo; Crawford explained&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Various key players are on board, said Crawford, including the Australian Energy Market Commission and Energy Consumers Australia. He pointed out that many of the changes needed, such as improving data access and informational services, are the responsibility of networks, which the ENA represents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	On the other hand, the roadmap is highly dependent on a substantial shift in policy. &amp;ldquo;Tariff reform to ensure efficient price signals for all customers and those with distributed energy resources is critical to supporting efficient customer and network investments,&amp;rdquo; said Crawford. &amp;ldquo;However, there is currently no enduring, clear long-term climate policy. There is also a lack of integration between electricity sector planning processes and climate policy.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	CSIRO&amp;rsquo;s chief energy economist, Paul Graham, warned that a lack of a stable, coordinated policy for energy in the country could derail the whole project.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And while the roadmap has been greeted with enthusiasm by much of the press, the reaction of electricity generators is difficult to gauge. The only reply to GTM&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;inquiries so far has been &amp;ldquo;No comment.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Led by the Solar Industry, Grid Modernization Created Over 100,000 American Jobs in 2016</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/44gHCWTDsNY/Grid-Modernization-Created-Over-100000-American-Jobs</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Grid-Modernization-Created-Over-100000-American-Jobs</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Grid modernization investments are creating a construction boom across America -- largely driven by the deployment of solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the Department of Energy&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/2017%20US%20Energy%20and%20Jobs%20Report_0.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;latest report on jobs&lt;/a&gt; in the energy sector, employment in the electric power sector rose 13 percent in 2016 as utilities and developers built new power plants, replaced aging equipment, and invested in new technologies to manage an increasingly complicated distribution grid.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There are now 860,869 people employed in the electric power sector, an increase of more than 101,000 jobs from 2015. Workers in the construction industry building solar, natural gas and wind power plants accounted for most of the increase, reported DOE. The coming year will likely bring a 7 percent bump in employment across power generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Coal has long been the dominant fuel for America&amp;#39;s electric grid, but &lt;a href="http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=25392" target="_blank"&gt;no longer.&lt;/a&gt; Utilities are burning less of it, and miners are digging less of it. Many politicians -- including the incoming president -- believe the decline of coal &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/business/energy-environment/a-bleak-outlook-for-trumps-promises-to-coal-miners.html?_r=0" target="_blank"&gt;is wrecking&lt;/a&gt; America&amp;#39;s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But the opposite is happening. Jobs are being created in new areas of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There were 26,000 megawatts of new power plant capacity installed last year in the U.S. Wind provided 6,800 megawatts of new capacity, natural gas provided 8,000 megawatts, and solar provided 9,500 megawatts, according to the Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The electric generation mix in the United States is changing, driven by the transition of coal-fired power plants to natural gas and the increase in low-carbon sources of energy. This transition has required significant build-out of new power generation facilities and technologies in the United States," writes the DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In fact, 10 percent of all U.S. construction jobs are now serving the electric power sector. And the majority of those jobs are being created by building out renewable power plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"The majority of these new jobs are classified by the&amp;nbsp;BLS to the construction industry and [consist of] employees installing and building new renewable energy capacity additions," writes DOE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And more specifically, solar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With 374,000 jobs, the solar industry dominates the electric power sector in terms of employment. It now accounts for 43 percent of the total workforce. Coal, oil and natural gas are the next biggest employers, accounting for 22 percent of jobs in the sector in total. Wind comes in third.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;img alt="" class="modal" src="/content/images/articles/solar_jobs_in_electric_power_generation_2016.png" style="max-width: 100%;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And looking outside the electric power sector specifically, there&amp;#39;s an even bigger job creator in cleantech: energy efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	According to the DOE jobs report, there are now 2.2 million people working in the energy-efficiency sector. These jobs are spread across many different sectors -- and include manufacturing energy-efficient equipment, weatherizing houses, and financing projects that adhere to the government&amp;#39;s Energy Star performance standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A majority of jobs in this sector -- 1.4 million -- are in construction. Another 290,000 people are employed in the manufacturing sector.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As President-elect Trump looks to rally Congress &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/19/trump-team-plans-for-infrastructure-task-force-to-advance-top-spending-priority/?utm_term=.6ab94cfe962a" target="_blank"&gt;around an infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt;, he has an obvious place to look: grid modernization and energy efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Italian Utility Enel Acquires Energy Storage Specialist Demand Energy</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/bwPBpZc6do4/italian-utility-enel-acquires-energy-storage-specialist-demand-energy</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/italian-utility-enel-acquires-energy-storage-specialist-demand-energy</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	The year in energy storage started off with a bang as Italian utility Enel acquired a &lt;a href="https://www.enelgreenpower.com/en/media/press/d201701-enel-acquires-us-based-energy-storage-software-and-project-developer-demand-energy.html" target="_blank"&gt;100 percent stake&lt;/a&gt; in U.S.-based Demand Energy, a developer and operator of energy storage systems and software, for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Enel&amp;#39;s renewables division operates 36 gigawatts of clean energy around the world. The North America subsidiary, which will control Demand Energy, has more than 100 plants spanning hydropower, wind, geothermal and solar energy, with a managed capacity of more than 2.8 gigawatts. That global portfolio now has become a ready and willing customer for Demand Energy&amp;#39;s storage and energy management software, named DEN.OS, for Distributed Energy Network Optimization System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"Through this transaction, we will be able to greatly strengthen our position in the growing battery storage market with a complementary partner and innovator," said Francesco Venturini, Enel&amp;rsquo;s head of global renewable energies, in a statement. &amp;ldquo;By combining our global presence and expertise in systems integration with Demand Energy&amp;rsquo;s software and established product offering, we will expand the development of renewables and storage both in the U.S. and globally, delivering a clean, reliable, high-tech and cost-effective energy solution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;#39;s not a bad outcome for the 30-person American startup with just 3 megawatts and 9 megawatt-hours of installed storage capacity under its belt. The goal now is to&amp;nbsp;quickly scale Demand Energy&amp;#39;s resources and capabilities, said&amp;nbsp;President and CEO Gregg Patterson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"As we were looking at our options, Enel clearly stood out," he said. "They have a monstrous renewables portfolio worldwide and they really wanted a dependable and capable software platform. We were looking for the ideal partner to scale and grow behind the meter, in front of the meter and in microgrids."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand Energy has taken an increasingly popular route for American storage and grid edge startups that have operational experience but need more capital to scale: find a European utility. The energy conglomerates across the pond have proven willing to invest money in emerging grid service companies, even if their American counterparts aren&amp;#39;t ready to pull out their wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	New York roots&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand Energy got started in the early days of advanced energy storage, back in 2008. At first the company chased the front-of-the-meter storage market, but found there wasn&amp;#39;t yet enough interest from utilities. Instead, it pivoted to behind the meter, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Demand-Energys-Intelligent-Storage-Mixes-Batteries-Analytics-and-Software"&gt;marketing to commercial property managers in New York City&lt;/a&gt;. The storage could help manage energy costs and demand charges, but there was something deeper at stake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the wake of Superstorm Sandy, New Yorkers were reeling from the instability of the metropolitan grid in the face of extreme weather events. In the high-flying skyline of the city, loss of power can mean elevators cut out and water stops pumping to the tops of buildings. These conditions created a compelling resilience business case for storage even without policy drivers like California&amp;#39;s statewide deployment mandate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2012, Demand Energy installed a demand shifting, &lt;a href="http://demandenergynetworks.com/pressroom-dev/latest/128-barclay-tower-becomes-world-s-first-intelligent-energy-storage-powered-high-rise" target="_blank"&gt;225-kilowatt, 2-megawatt-hour battery system&lt;/a&gt; in the basement of Manhattan&amp;#39;s 58-story Barclay Tower, a luxury residential building. The success of that project generated more business with the property owner, Glenwood Management, that culminated in 1 megawatt of energy storage distributed across its property portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	As it deployed more systems, Demand Energy tapped into the market-based incentives available in New York, such as utility Consolidated Edison&amp;#39;s demand management programs for the Indian Point nuclear plant and the Brooklyn and Queens substation deferral. In each of those cases, the utility opted to pay for distributed demand management as a cheaper alternative to larger capital expenditures for grid upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced this week that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/nyregion/cuomo-indian-point-nuclear-plant.html" target="_blank"&gt;Indian Point nuclear power plant will shut down&lt;/a&gt; by April 2021, eliminating generation capacity equal to one-quarter of the power demand in NYC and Westchester County, according to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. That news underscores the city&amp;#39;s growing need to meet peak demand through sources other than conventional, big-ticket grid upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most recently, Demand Energy has been finishing up a &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-grid-microgrid-bqdm-con-ed-peak"&gt;microgrid&lt;/a&gt; at an affordable housing complex in Brooklyn, combining rooftop solar, a fuel cell and lithium-ion batteries. The system will cut electricity burden for the buildings, ensure resilience in event of a blackout and serve the broader grid through the demand response program, which also provides a source of revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	The brains in the system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this acquisition, Enel gets a company with years of experience deploying and operating storage in front of the meter, behind the meter and in microgrids. The utility, though, appears most excited about the company&amp;#39;s software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The capabilities of DEN.OS developed through each phase of the startup&amp;#39;s evolution. The early switch from utility-sited to customer-sited projects forced the company&amp;#39;s engineers to develop a more complex control paradigm. A utility storage system typically operates in response to SCADA control signals from a central command center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"Behind the meter, you don&amp;#39;t have anyone telling you what do you -- you just have the load," said Doug Staker, vice president for global sales at Demand Energy. "Based on cost factors, what&amp;rsquo;s the best economic operation? You have to be more situationally aware and economically driven."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The IP they created looks at how much energy a building is using, how much it costs to charge and discharge the batteries, what programs are available to participate in for money, what price signals the market is sending and more, and then determines how the battery should operate to maximize economic return for the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Managing a network of storage systems across Glenwood&amp;#39;s different properties offered proof of concept for the software&amp;#39;s ability to aggregate across different sites and optimize for a broader challenge than any one site. The microgrid work shows the ability to manage different forms of generation, as well as storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The result: a platform that the company says can optimize system-wide energy operations, not only for storage project but also generation, transmission and distribution and microgrids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"It can be deployed across pretty much any electricity system that&amp;rsquo;s out there," Patterson said. "We had the ability to prove and verify the capabilities of our software. Enel spent lot of time really making sure the technology delivered."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The pairing with Enel now opens the door to more storage project development around the world, but the software has the potential to scale much faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	"This is all about the software," Patterson said. "Software is really portable and fungible. We can quickly move and deploy it."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Now the team will be able to do so around the world with the backing of Enel&amp;#39;s worldwide business development resources, as well as its engineering, construction, operation and maintenance expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
	European invasion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Demand Energy had multiple interested parties, both domestic and international, Patterson said. Still, it&amp;#39;s notable that a European utility won out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Multinational energy companies based in Europe have shown strong initiative in racking up large renewable energy portfolios and moving swiftly to acquire startups that will help them manage the decentralization and decarbonization of the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In September, a subsidiary of French mega-utility EDF &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/groom-energy-acquired-by-dk-energy-edf"&gt;acquired Groom Energy Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, a Massachusetts-based, full-service energy services company serving customers with big portfolios of buildings in the commercial and industrial space. That gave the French company 67 pairs of boots on the ground to grow its business in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	French utility Engie &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/behind-the-meter-battery-acquisition-engie-takes-majority-stake-in-green-ch"&gt;bought an 80 percent stake&lt;/a&gt; in California-based C&amp;amp;I storage specialist Green Charge Networks in May. The buyer said it would use the acquisition to deploy standalone storage and storage-plus-solar configurations for clients in the United States. Engie also &lt;a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160225005330/en/ENGIE-Acquires-OpTerra-Energy-Services" target="_blank"&gt;bought energy services company OpTerra&lt;/a&gt; in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A subsidiary of U.K.-based Centrica &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/direct-energy-buys-panoramic-power-for-60m"&gt;bought circuit-level energy sensor company Panoramic Power&lt;/a&gt; in November 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;#39;s just to name a few, and not including strategic investments. Several U.S. utilities have invested in solar installers in recent years, but haven&amp;#39;t shown as much interest in storage or grid services acquisitions, with a few exceptions like Southern Company&amp;#39;s &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/southern-company-goes-big-into-microgrids-with-413m-acquisition-of-powersec"&gt;large purchase of microgrid leader PowerSecure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If U.S. power providers want to get in on the distributed grid action eventually, there may be a danger to waiting -- the most promising startups might already be taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>The Quadrennial Energy Review Offers a Plan for Grid ModernizationâIf Trumpâs Team Wants It</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/weXfkVJKnbw/The-Quadrennial-Energy-Review-Is-a-Roadmap-for-Grid-Modernization</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/The-Quadrennial-Energy-Review-Is-a-Roadmap-for-Grid-Modernization</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Last week, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz presented the Obama administration&amp;rsquo;s final wish list to the incoming Trump administration, in the form of the second installment of its Quadrennial Energy Review. &lt;a href="https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2017/01/f34/Transforming%20the%20Nationâs%20Electricity%20System--Summary%20for%20Policymakers.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;QER 1.2&lt;/a&gt;, as it&amp;rsquo;s called, is the highest-level public statement from the outgoing Obama administration on its &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2017/01/09/new-study-helps-map-out-road-ahead-us-electricity-system" target="_blank"&gt;energy priorities&lt;/a&gt; and policies, with 76 recommendations focused on securing and modernizing the electric grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much of the news coverage has focused on the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-06/grid-in-imminent-danger-from-cyber-threats-energy-report-says" target="_blank"&gt;report&amp;rsquo;s cybersecurity warnings&lt;/a&gt; and calls to action -- specifically, its citation of Russian-orchestrated cyberattacks on a Ukrainian utility &amp;ldquo;as an indicator of what is possible" for the U.S. grid. It&amp;rsquo;s an important topic, given the reports by U.S. intelligence agencies of Russian hacking into the recently concluded election, and the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-real-cybersecurity-issues-behind-the-overhyped-russia-hacks-the-grid-st"&gt;ultimately false, though thought-provoking&lt;/a&gt;, reports this month of a hacked laptop at Vermont utility Burlington Electric.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But QER 1.2 also contains a long list of Energy Department ideas for modernizing the grid. Some of them come with big price tags -- $350 billion and $500 billion required to upgrade grid infrastructure nationwide, increased funding for nuclear power, or the tens of billions of dollars it&amp;rsquo;s seeking to invest from its loan guarantee program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Others are cheaper, like programs to educate local and state utilities on technology and policy, or employment development programs to help replace the aging utility workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Distributed energy is also an area of focus, with a proposal to &amp;ldquo;significantly expand existing programs to demonstrate the integration and optimization of distribution system technologies,&amp;rdquo; and extending cybersecurity planning and standards to include distribution and behind-the-meter assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The first version of the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/quadrennial-energy-review-calls-for-billions-in-new-grid-investment"&gt;QER, released in April 2015&lt;/a&gt;, called for $3.5 billion in investment to modernize and strengthen the power grid, amidst a total of 63 proposals for the electricity, oil and gas, and transportation sectors. Of those, 21 were fully or partially enacted into law and 29 were implemented by the Obama administration. At Friday&amp;rsquo;s event, Secretary Moniz made the case for bipartisan support in Congress to push these new proposals forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s unlikely that DOE&amp;rsquo;s new ideas can expect the same success rate with &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-department-of-energy-under-president-trump"&gt;President-elect Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt;, incoming &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/rick-perry-governor-of-largest-wind-power-state-is-trumps-pick-for-head-of"&gt;DOE secretary Rick Perry&lt;/a&gt;, a DOE transition team that&amp;rsquo;s already &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-trump-team-wants-names-of-people-working-on-climate"&gt;asking for the names of climate-change researchers&lt;/a&gt;, and a U.S. Congress controlled by the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In light of these realities, many of the suggestions coming from last week&amp;rsquo;s report are couched in terms of expanding existing DOE programs, or subtly altering others to gain support from industry partners, particularly utilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take its concept for DOE&amp;rsquo;s Title XVII loan guarantee program, which has loaned about $32 billion to mostly successful renewable energy funding (but is best known publicly for its $535 million loan to failed solar panel maker Solyndra). The program, which recently reported that its portfolio has &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/trump-cant-kill-the-doe-loan-program-but-it-may-still-be-at-risk"&gt;paid about $1.65 billion&lt;/a&gt; in interest payments to the U.S. Treasury, still has about $40 billion allocated for loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But it&amp;rsquo;s easy to see how the Trump administration might be opposed to supporting a program that loans money to solar companies. While Congress would have to act to end the program entirely, the Energy Secretary could simply stop signing off on new loans, effectively killing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This may be why the DOE&amp;rsquo;s latest suggestions for the Title XVII program ask for changes that would allow it to expand beyond generation projects secured by power-purchase agreements, and into &amp;ldquo;grid modernization financing by regulated entities,&amp;rdquo; that is, utilities. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the report described it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-left:.5in;"&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Some of the benefits of grid modernization are realized over time, as the electricity system itself is changed by technology and market innovations. Additional funding resources would bridge the gap between investment costs and realization of benefits and would enable utilities to invest in grid modernization. A relatively low-cost permanent Federal financing system could be established by setting up a revolving loan fund with one-time seed capital.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Much of the need behind this change in loan program rules is driven by the anticipated need for new technologies at the transmission-grid level, the report said. &amp;ldquo;By their nature, transmission projects, especially big projects, involve many entities and jurisdictions,&amp;rdquo; adding that &amp;ldquo;statutory clarification is needed on indirect lending authorities to such entities.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same time, DOE has already &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/distributed-energy-at-center-of-does-new-1b-loan-guarantee-fund"&gt;earmarked $1 billion in loans&lt;/a&gt; for programs that combine distributed energy assets and technologies, including one centered on advanced fossil fuels, as well as another focused on renewable energy and energy efficiency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	DOE is also running an important set of distributed energy and distribution grid projects, largely under the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-standards-based-microgrid-meets-the-industrial-internet-of-things"&gt;aegis of federal labs&lt;/a&gt;, including the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), and through its cutting-edge technology grant program, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/arpa-e-funds-the-next-wave-of-grid-distributed-energy-integration"&gt;ARPA-E&lt;/a&gt;. As part of its QER process, DOE in early 2016 released a grid modernization multi-year plan that &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/breaking-down-does-new-220m-grid-modernization-plan"&gt;called for $220 million&lt;/a&gt; to support 80-plus projects of this type across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	These types of programs, unlike those focused on climate change or renewable energy, haven&amp;rsquo;t been specifically targeted for opposition from the Trump administration. Instead, they&amp;rsquo;re mostly grid-centric -- and under DOE&amp;rsquo;s latest proposal, they should be leveraged to help utilities &amp;ldquo;demonstrate advanced distribution system technologies at the community scale.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The list of technologies included advanced voltage control/optimization systems; dynamic protection schemes to manage reverse power flows, communications, sensors, storage, switching and smart-inverter networks; and advanced distribution management systems, including automated substations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The program envisioned would support cost-share programs to &amp;ldquo;inform standards and regulations and increase regulatory and utility confidence in key technologies or technology systems.&amp;rdquo; Utilities would have to make a positive business case and obtain regulatory approvals, with preference for multi-utility partnerships with diverse customer profiles. And, of course, &amp;ldquo;Cybersecurity plans for all projects would be required and supported by programmatic review of plans and deployments.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>Nissan, Honda Tease New EVs With Grid Services Capabilities</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/6tc7v8U1BBk/nissan-honda-tease-new-evs-with-grid-service-capabilities</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/nissan-honda-tease-new-evs-with-grid-service-capabilities</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Less than a decade has passed since modern electric cars started coming to market, and already these vehicles are being asked to do much more than move people from point A to point B emissions-free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, electric vehicles (EVs) are being equipped to drive autonomously, connect with a myriad of other devices and even read human emotions to provide an enhanced mobility experience. EVs are also changing their relationship with the electric grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Nissan was one of the first automakers to introduce a next-generation all-electric car in the U.S. with the launch of the Leaf in 2010. This week, at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, the company teased that it will launch a new version of the all-electric Leaf &amp;ldquo;in the near future.&amp;rdquo; The EV will come equipped with Nissan&amp;rsquo;s ProPilot technology that will allow the car to drive autonomously in certain highway driving conditions. It will also be designed with an eye to providing grid services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We are also making significant advancements to make sure EVs also provide alternative energy sources for communities,&amp;rdquo; said Nissan Senior Vice President Takao Asami, during a keynote session at CES yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	If electric vehicles reach a mass scale, it&amp;rsquo;s simply not feasible for the electric grid to handle that additional load with the way EVs are currently used, Asami said in an interview. &amp;ldquo;We have to start adjusting how we charge electric vehicles,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smart charging -- where EVs are equipped to start and stop charging at times that are more beneficial&amp;nbsp;for the grid -- isn&amp;rsquo;t a new concept, but more advanced systems where EVs charge in concert with intermittent renewable energy sources (like Nissan&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.hitachi.com/New/cnews/131218.html" target="_blank"&gt;Maui smart grid project&lt;/a&gt;) are still in the development stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	What&amp;rsquo;s also new is that automakers are starting to embrace two-way charging, or vehicle-to-grid (V2G) configurations, where power flows back and forth between the grid and the electric car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Automakers have been hesitant to support two-way power flow, citing concerns over the possible degradation of the battery, which could create warranty issues and potentially make the battery less safe. But Asami says things have changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Before we had the concern about the degradation of the battery -- that&amp;rsquo;s why we had to limit the amount of energy we could pull out of the vehicle,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;But year by year, this durability is being improved.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have to pull out all of the energy,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;Instead, as we have more and more electric vehicles, it really makes sense to pull a small portion of energy from the electric vehicle battery capacity to support peak power for a building needs, which we are already doing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In 2012, Nissan introduced &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1095193_nissan-leaf-to-home-electric-car-power-tests-more-practical-for-u-s-with-longer-range-cars" target="_blank"&gt;Leaf to Home&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; power system in Japan that converts high-voltage direct current from a Leaf&amp;#39;s lithium-ion battery pack into the 100-volt alternating current used by Japanese homes. In 2014, Nissan started testing the use of Leaf batteries and vehicle-to-home systems to &lt;a href="http://www.nissan-global.com/EN/NEWS/2014/_STORY/141016-02-e.html" target="_blank"&gt;power a dealership&amp;rsquo;s lighting system&lt;/a&gt; during peak hours, in order to reduce demand on the grid. The company has also used six Nissan Leafs to &lt;a href="http://evobsession.com/6-nissan-leafs-power-office-building-japan/" target="_blank"&gt;power an office building&lt;/a&gt; during peak hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Today, roughly 4,000 customers in Japan are currently using EVs to &lt;a href="http://www.fleetcarma.com/electric-vehicles-relief-japans-grid/" target="_blank"&gt;manage their home energy usage&lt;/a&gt; with two-way power flow, said Asami. Hundreds of customers are testing vehicle-to-grid applications using Leafs in the &lt;a href="https://www.greenbiz.com/article/nissan-takes-tesla-vehicle-grid-energy-tech-race" target="_blank"&gt;U.K&lt;/a&gt;. and &lt;a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/williampentland/2015/12/08/nissan-pilots-vehicle-to-grid-technology-in-denmark/#b9f389a977d5" target="_blank"&gt;Denmark&lt;/a&gt;. And in the U.S., there are several pilot projects testing V2G technology currently underway, including a test at the &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Air-Force-Tests-First-EV-Fleet-With-Two-Way-Power-Flow-In-California"&gt;L.A. Air Force Base&lt;/a&gt; to see how well EVs, including several Leafs, can provide ancillary grid services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the launch of the next-generation Leaf, Asami indicated that V2G applications could start to become mainstream. The technology that allows EVs to operate in sync with the grid is &amp;ldquo;more or less&amp;rdquo; available today, he said. How and where the technology is rolled out will really depend on policymakers and on the energy supply of the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The case for using an EV to send and receive power from the grid is most compelling in places where peak electricity costs are high. If utilities work to set up viable compensation schemes, EV owners could get paid for their energy-saving activities, which could help accelerate even greater adoption of EVs and significantly reduce carbon emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	One problem with that vision, however, is that Nissan leaders didn&amp;rsquo;t say when the new Leaf would be coming to market. What&amp;#39;s more, they said very little else about what the new EV would offer -- which was somewhat of a disappointment following last year&amp;rsquo;s CES release of the Chevy Bolt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The fact that we are extremely conservative in our communication about what&amp;rsquo;s coming is because we are active in the market and we are selling cars, and we just want to make sure that the cars we put on the market can have full development,&amp;rdquo; said Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;But we want to compete on electric cars; we want to be present,&amp;rdquo; he added. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t intend to keep one car in one segment of the market.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;rsquo;s unclear how long potential U.S. customers will have to wait before they can know more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	EV enthusiasts were also teased at CES this week with Honda&amp;rsquo;s NeuV concept car. The small, square EV features wireless inductive charging and Level 4 vehicle autonomy, as well as Honda&amp;rsquo;s Automated Network Assistant (HANA) that can read a driver&amp;rsquo;s moods and support safe driving choices. HANA also controls infotainment options, enables digital payments through a partnership with Visa, and manages NeuV as part of an autonomous shared driving fleet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The NeuV is also designed not only to charge when electricity prices are low, but also to sell electricity back to the grid during peak times -- with HANA&amp;rsquo;s artificial intelligence (AI) serving as the electricity market trader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;AI regulates the inductive charging, so you can basically charge back to the grid, make a little money if you don&amp;rsquo;t need to drive that day or charge when the rates are lower and save some money,&amp;rdquo; said Jarad Hall, Honda&amp;rsquo;s advanced design group leader, in an interview. &amp;ldquo;You can also lease the car out for ridesharing&amp;nbsp;and make a little money that way.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Hall stressed that the NeuV is a concept car with no release date planned, but noted that Honda is developing all of the technologies on board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;We wanted to take all the technologies we have and make it a unique story for a younger buyer about what an entry-level Honda could be,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Honda hasn&amp;rsquo;t really positioned itself as an EV leader. The company only offers one fully electric car in the U.S -- the Honda Fit EV. Hall noted that&amp;rsquo;s partly because the people at Honda are &amp;ldquo;perfectionists&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t want to enter the market until they&amp;rsquo;re sure they have a super compelling offering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	So while Honda&amp;#39;s and Nissan&amp;rsquo;s announcements signal an important shift toward a world where zero-emissions vehicles play a more active role on the grid, interested consumers, and the utilities that stand to benefit from these technologies, will have to wait a little longer before automakers are ready to fully to serve the grid network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>The Real Cybersecurity Issues Behind the Overhyped âRussia Hacks the Gridâ Story</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/jNFPkeQfWOc/the-real-cybersecurity-issues-behind-the-overhyped-russia-hacks-the-grid-st</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-real-cybersecurity-issues-behind-the-overhyped-russia-hacks-the-grid-st</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	Over the past few days, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen a story about Russian agents hacking the U.S. power grid spread like wildfire across the internet -- only to be &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Fake-News-of-Russian-Cyber-Attack-On-Vermont-Utility-Goes-Viral-Before-Trut"&gt;debunked as a wild overstatement&lt;/a&gt; of the facts at hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Yes, a single laptop belonging to Vermont utility Burlington Electric was found to have visited an IP address cited by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI as being associated with a Russian hacking operation, dubbed Grizzly Steppe, that also hacked the U.S government during the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	But there&amp;rsquo;s no evidence that this amounted to anything other than a utility employee checking his or her Yahoo email account, as the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russian-government-hackers-do-not-appear-to-have-targeted-vermont-utility-say-people-close-to-investigation/2017/01/02/70c25956-d12c-11e6-945a-76f69a399dd5_story.html?utm_term=.b1f1d9b8f24b" target="_blank"&gt;reported Monday&lt;/a&gt; in what amounts to an extensive retraction of its Friday story that started the firestorm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the same time, cybersecurity experts see the potential to learn from the whole affair. After all, the very real &lt;a href="http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerabilities---threats/lessons-from-the-ukraine-electric-grid-hack/d/d-id/1324743" target="_blank"&gt;shutdowns of Ukrainian grid&lt;/a&gt; substations in December 2015 -- the first-ever confirmed cyberattack against grid infrastructure -- got started through similarly innocuous intrusions into utility IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	That&amp;rsquo;s the conclusion of a &lt;a href="http://ics.sans.org/media/E-ISAC_SANS_Ukraine_DUC_5.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;report from the SANS&amp;nbsp;Institute&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity training organization that traced the Ukrainian outage to a sophisticated campaign. The attackers gained entry to utility computers and obtained user credentials and passwords, as well as other key data. They then used that information to infiltrate the industrial control systems (ICS) and automated grid devices such as breakers, serial-to-ethernet data converters and uninterruptible power systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	There&amp;rsquo;s no evidence whatsoever that anything like this has happened in Vermont, or elsewhere in reported instances of cyber-intrusions into U.S. grid systems. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that these possibilities should be dismissed out of hand, Mihir Kapadia, vice president of engineering for cybersecurity firm &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/finding-the-hidden-cyber-threats-in-the-power-grid"&gt;N-Dimension&lt;/a&gt;, said in a Tuesday interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Most of the threat indicators coming from the &lt;a href="https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/JAR_16-20296A_GRIZZLY%20STEPPE-2016-1229.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;FBI-DHS Joint Analysis Report (JAR)&lt;/a&gt; were &amp;ldquo;what we would deem weak indicators,&amp;rdquo; Kapadia said. &amp;ldquo;When we get information like this, the first step is to analyze and vet it, and start to classify it. There are some weak indicators of compromise -- which by no means people should ignore. But it&amp;rsquo;s all a starting point for a deeper investigation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the case of the Burlington Electric laptop&amp;#39;s visit to a JAR-flagged IP address, &amp;ldquo;There are a lot of legitimate reasons why you would have traffic between one of your machines and Yahoo,&amp;rdquo; he said. At the same time, hackers often use servers to launch phishing attacks -- posing as a real company to engage computer users in email exchanges or website visits that deliver malware to their computers -- and then move on to different servers after some time. &amp;ldquo;If we have recorded timestamps of these events, we can start to piece it together," said Kapadia. "Was this done under suspicious circumstances, or does it represent legitimate traffic?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Other, stronger threat indicators from the DHS-FBI report include injection flaw techniques&amp;nbsp;that attempt to send commands to a browser or database, or cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that allow attackers to insert and execute unauthorized code in web applications. &amp;ldquo;Based on our analysis, we&amp;rsquo;d say that&amp;rsquo;s not a strong indicator -- it&amp;rsquo;s probably a medium indicator of compromise, since it&amp;rsquo;s more specific," Kapadia said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	All of these threat indicators pertain to a &amp;ldquo;Stage 1&amp;rdquo; cyberattack on a utility -- the part targeting its business IT equipment and networks. Moving on to &amp;ldquo;Stage 2&amp;rdquo; requires the leap from IT systems and into the operations technology (OT) networks, such as the SCADA networks that run power grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Companies typically rely on the separation between corporate IT networks and OT systems to bar entry from one to the other. But &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;re too comfortable relying on that separation,&amp;rdquo; Edgard Capdevielle, CEO of industrial control system cybersecurity startup &lt;a href="http://blog.nozominetworks.com/index.php/2017/01/02/ukraine-vermont-utility-cyberattacks-highlight-need-for-robust-ics-security-in-2017/" target="_blank"&gt;Nozomi Networks&lt;/a&gt;, said in a Tuesday interview. With the increasing level of automation and interconnection between IT and OT, &amp;ldquo;that is a permeable wall; it is not a brick wall," he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Specifically, hackers with access to IT networks can gather credentials and passwords that allow them to access the virtual private networks that connect business networks to OT systems, breach the firewalls between the two, and gain control of devices like remote terminal units and programmable logic controllers that operate automated industrial or grid equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Protecting these OT systems is complicated by the fact that they tend to run on software that&amp;rsquo;s years out of date, Capdevielle added. &amp;ldquo;The technology adoption and innovation in the OT side of the fence is lagging,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;These sets of folks are just moving off Windows XP. Windows 7 is just happening right now -- which for IT, happened seven to 10 years ago. So that means they have very little visibility, very little control, very little asset management on the PLC side of the house. The ability to troubleshoot things is not the best.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Making use of access to OT systems requires a high level of understanding of the industrial or grid systems they command, in order to achieve the effects attackers are after. That&amp;rsquo;s a more complicated matter than hacking IT systems to steal data or run denial-of-service attacks. &amp;ldquo;In many cases, there is significantly more value, depending on the attacker&amp;rsquo;s current goals, in performing espionage than in perpetrating an actual attack that would include the destruction or manipulation of systems,&amp;rdquo; according to a SANS Institute report on the subject,&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/ICS/industrial-control-system-cyber-kill-chain-36297#__utma=195150004.39002332.1463500658.1483020004.1483125347.74&amp;amp;__utmb=195150004.7.9.1483380973836&amp;amp;__utmc=195150004&amp;amp;__utmx=-&amp;amp;__utmz=195150004.1482865694.70.13.utmcsr=google|utmccn=(organic)|utmcmd=organic|utmctr=(not%20provided)&amp;amp;__utmv=-&amp;amp;__utmk=118543945" target="_blank"&gt;Industrial Control System Kill-Chain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Even so, it&amp;rsquo;s important to identify Stage 1 threats that are leading up to a full Stage 2 &amp;ldquo;cyber-physical attack,&amp;rdquo; since &amp;ldquo;sustained access provides the opportunity for attackers to initiate follow-on actions later if they align with national security or military goals and/or criminal objectives,&amp;rdquo; the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In this context, the fact that the Burlington Electric laptop in question wasn&amp;rsquo;t connected to the utility&amp;rsquo;s OT network isn&amp;rsquo;t very reassuring, said Michael Assante, the ICS/SCADA lead at the SANS Institute, who co-authored the reports on the Ukrainian grid cyberattack and the ICS Kill-Chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;The whole goal is to get a host, and then start harvesting credentials,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;If that laptop was really associated with [Russian intelligence services] activity, and there&amp;rsquo;s malware on it, and it was discovered five weeks later, that&amp;rsquo;s ample time for the bad guy to achieve significant persistence and control. They&amp;rsquo;re far past that laptop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	To be clear, Assante isn&amp;rsquo;t suggesting that&amp;rsquo;s what happened in the case of Burlington Electric. But he did note that the Department of Homeland Security&amp;rsquo;s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) has documented attempts by &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/dhs-russian-hackers-infiltrated-us-energy-infrastructure"&gt;Russia to access U.S. energy infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; over the last five years, using malware such as Black Energy 2 and Havex, that were only discovered months to years after their introduction. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Havex and Black Energy 2 were both campaigns discovered in the 2013-2014 timeframe,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;They were pretty broad-reaching access campaigns, in Europe and the United States, getting into infrastructure through various techniques,&amp;rdquo; including some complicated efforts such as &amp;ldquo;Trojan-izing&amp;rdquo; industrial control system vendor software update files to gain access and compromise systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;People are spending money to do this. And when we learned about them, peeled the onion layers back, they had been going for some time -- we caught them later in the game," said Assante. "So I am concerned we have had compromises to the infrastructure.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;

      <title>UK Startup to Use Blockchain for Meter Registration</title>
      <link>http://feeds.greentechmedia.com/~r/GTM_SmartGrid/~3/FYkIwUDodGE/UK-Startup-To-Use-Blockchain-For-Meter-Registration</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/UK-Startup-To-Use-Blockchain-For-Meter-Registration</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;
	A U.K. startup called &lt;a href="http://www.electron.org.uk"&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt; is proposing a blockchain-based electricity and gas meter registration system to help consumers switch between utilities more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Blockchain technology enables reliable coordination between multiple parties without the need for a central coordinating entity,&amp;rdquo; said Electron in a press release. &amp;ldquo;The company sees this platform as a first step in harnessing blockchain technology to transform the virtual infrastructure of the energy industry.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Registering meter details on a blockchain could help U.K. utilities comply with upcoming regulation that is expected to allow consumers to change from one energy provider to another in a single day, said Electron chief operating officer Joanna Hubbard. Currently, because there is no central register of all electricity and gas meters, it can take between 17 and 20 days to change utilities in the U.K. A blockchain could cut this time to &amp;ldquo;mere minutes,&amp;rdquo; Electron believes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The U.K. energy regulator, Ofgem, launched the next-day switching proposal in February 2015. The consultation period for the proposal has now closed and utilities are awaiting a final decision. &amp;ldquo;We propose to lead a program of work to deliver these policy proposals for consumers by 2019,&amp;rdquo; Ofgem says &lt;a href="https://www.ofgem.gov.uk/publications-and-updates/moving-reliable-next-day-switching-consultation-target-operating-model-and-delivery-approach"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ofgem believes the measure can be achieved &amp;ldquo;by replacing the existing network-run gas and electricity switching services with a new centralized switching service.&amp;rdquo; If created in a traditional manner, though, the switching service would need to build and maintain a massive database of meter information, which Hubbard says would be costly and unwieldy. Using a blockchain would be &amp;ldquo;millions cheaper,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the advent of blockchain technology, &amp;ldquo;a central database sounds very inefficient now,&amp;rdquo; she commented. Furthermore, she said, the blockchain approach would make it easier to integrate the meter data into applications such as demand response or peer-to-peer energy trading. This is where the real interest lies as far as Electron is concerned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The company intends to offer the meter registration blockchain as a free platform to utilities, and then create value-added services around it. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not looking to commercialize this,&amp;rdquo; Hubbard said. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re looking to deliver it to the industry; then we are well placed to build on it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For now, however, Electron still has a long way to go before making this plan a reality. The company has shown its concept could work in theory, by creating an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum"&gt;Ethereum blockchain&lt;/a&gt; and filling it with simulated data from 53 million metering points and 60 energy suppliers. However, the company needs to get the U.K. electricity sector on board, starting with utilities, and &amp;ldquo;we&amp;rsquo;d have to get buy-in from Ofgem,&amp;rdquo; said Hubbard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	She said Electron was already in talks with potential utility partners and &amp;ldquo;the reception has been very warm,&amp;rdquo; although none had yet signed up for the concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Smaller energy providers were interested because faster switching might allow them to pick up new customers more quickly, she noted. For larger energy companies, the interest was more around the development of blockchain-based applications such as demand response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With the right partnerships in place, Hubbard said Electron, which is backed by &amp;pound;500,000 ($617,000) from private investors and &amp;pound;150,000 ($185,000) from two &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/innovate-uk"&gt;Innovate U.K&lt;/a&gt;. grants, could roll out the blockchain registry within 18 to 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Electron&amp;rsquo;s proposal comes amid growing interest in the use of blockchains across the energy sector. &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/siemens-joins-growing-blockchain-bandwagon"&gt;Siemens recently announced&lt;/a&gt; it would be collaborating with a U.S. company called LO3 Energy on a peer-to-peer energy trading blockchain project in New York.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	And in a &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-energy-blockchain-could-bitcoin-be-a-catalyst-for-the-distributed-grid"&gt;February 2016 forum&lt;/a&gt; moderated by GTM CEO Scott Clavenna, Joi Ito, the director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology&amp;#39;s media lab, declared: "It would be a waste to use the blockchain to just do meter billing." Hubbard acknowledges that blockchain&amp;rsquo;s potential goes far beyond meter data, but said someone needs to provide the infrastructure to aggregate metering information in the first place. &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re the only people doing this top-down approach,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The idea is that other blockchains (for example for tokens or peer-to-peer trading) will be interoperable with Electron&amp;rsquo;s platform, and that all told this could have a transformational effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	For now, in the U.K, &amp;ldquo;This industry still takes 14 months to settle financial transactions,&amp;rdquo; said Hubbard. &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot that has to change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="feedflare"&gt;
